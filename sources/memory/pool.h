\brief Class definitions and function declarations for the classes
SimplePool and Pool, which manage memory allocation for the templates
stlset::Set and stlvector::Vector respectively.

The idea is that these substitutes for the standard library templates
std::set and std::vector offer easier access for debugging
memory problems.

  Our memory pool always hands out blocks of T whose sizes are powers of
  2, regardless of the actual request. This seems to mesh well with the way
  push_back is usally implemented.
