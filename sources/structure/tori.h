  /*!
  \brief Represents a torus defined over R.

  This is equivalent to the datum of a lattice with an involution;
  to be consistent with the rest of the program, we use the Cartan
  involution tau which is the negative of the Galois involution on
  the character lattice.

  The fundamental data are the rank d_rank (allowing us to identify the
  character lattice X with d_rank-tuples of integers) and the integer
  matrix d_involution of tau.

  The software constructs two sublattices X_+ and X_-, the +1 and -1
  eigenspaces for the involution. The datum d_plus is a basis of X_+,
  and d_minus is a basis of X_-.  Both X_+ and X_- are supplementable
  in X, but in general X is not equal to the direct sum X_+ + X_-.

  The most delicate invariant we shall have to deal with is the component
  group of the group of real points of T. This is an elementary abelian
  2-group; we shall rather consider its dual dpi0(T). To describe its rank is
  fairly easy. Indeed, T may be decomposed as a product of compact, split and
  complex factors; denote r_u, r_s and r_c the number of factors of each type,
  so that the rank n of T is r_u + r_s + 2 r_c, then the rank of the component
  group is r_s. We have moreover : rk(X_+) = r_u + r_c; rk(X_-) = r_s + r_c.
  Denote V = X/2X, a vector space over the two-element field F_2, and denote
  V_+,V_- the images of X_+, X_- in V. Then it is not hard to show that r_c =
  dim(V_+ cap V_-), which allows computing r_s once rk(X_-) is known.
  One may prove that V_+- := V_+ cap V_- is also the image of tau - 1 in V.

  It is a little bit harder to describe dpi0(T) functorially as a vector
  space. The group T(2)(R) of real points of the group of elements of order 2
  in T is in natural duality with V/V_+-. There is a natural surjection from
  T(2)(R) to pi0(T), so dpi0(T) is a sub-vector space of V/V_+-, which may in
  fact be described as the image of V_-. This is how we will consider it.
