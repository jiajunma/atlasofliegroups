\brief Describes "the fiber" (over a fixed involution of a torus) in
twisted Tits group.

This is an important but somewhat subtle class. In fact none of the data
stored directly describes the mentioned fiber, nor is it relevant here where
the "elements of the fiber" really live. There is a "fiber group" (which is
a vector space over $Z/2Z$) that acts simply transitively on the fiber, in
other words, the fiber is an affine space over $Z/2Z$ with the fiber group
as space of translations. After a choice of a base point, the fiber itself
can be identified which this fiber group. The way a fiber element manifests
itself is via a grading it defines on the imaginary roots; this grading is
determined for the entire fiber by giving the "base grading" for the base
point, and the "grading shifts" for translations by each of a set of
generators of the grading group.

We fix an involutive automorphism $\tau$ of the complex torus $H$, and
consider the collection of all strong real forms $x$ of $G$ (which are
elements of "G semidirect delta") that induce tau on H, modulo the conjugation
action of H on the collection. Such a strong real form has square equal to
some element z in Z(G)^delta. Changing the element z by (1+delta)Z is
innocuous, and there are finitely many possibilities for Z^delta/[(1+delta)Z].
For each fixed value of z, this collection of strong real form representatives
in $G.\delta$ (modulo H conjugation) has a simply transitive action (left
multiplication) of the fiber group H^{-tau}/(1-tau)H, the component group of
the complex group H^{-tau} of fixed points of -tau. The fiber group is a
$Z/2Z$ vector space that can be realized as a subquotient of the group H(2) of
elements of order 2 (or 1) in H.

Equivalence classes of strong real forms (still with a fixed value of z) give
a partition of the fiber group (depending on z). These partitions are stored
in d_strongReal, and accessed by the function fiber_partition.

An equivalence class of strong real forms may be labelled by a pair of
integers: the second labelling the element z (or rather its coset modulo
[(1+delta)Z]), and the first the equivalence class in the fiber group.

  \brief Fiber group.

  In terms of the complex torus $H$ and the Cartan involution $\tau$, it
  is equal to $F=H^{-\tau}/(1-\tau)H$: the group of fixed points of
  $\-tau$, modulo its identity component. Here additive notation is used
  for multiplicative composition; e.g., $1-\tau$ maps $z\in H$ to
  $z/\tau(z)$; this notation is natural when $\tau$ is viewed as
  operating on the weight lattice, in which case $1-\tau$ acts as the
  identity matrix minus the matrix giving $\tau$.

  Recall that the group of real points $H(R)$ is a product of $p$ unit circle
  groups, $q$ groups $R^\times$, and $r$ groups $C^\times$. It is easy to see
  that $F=(\Z/2\Z)^p$, with one factor $\Z/2\Z$ coming from each circle.

  The fiber group is represented as a subquotient of the group $H(2)$ of
  elements of order 2 (or 1) in the torus. Write $Y$ for the lattice of
  coweights of $H$; then one has natural isomorphisms $H(2)=(1/2)Y/Y=Y/2Y$.
  The Cartan involution $\tau$ is always represented by the matrix $q$ of
  its action on the character lattice $X$, which is dual to $Y$; so its action
  on $Y$ is given by the matrix $q^t$. The action of $-\tau$ on $Y$ is
  given by $-q^t$.

  Because $H$ is the product (not direct) of the connected groups
  $(H^\tau)_0$ and $(H^{-\tau})_0$, the group $H^\tau$ meets every
  component of $H^{-tau}$. The intersection of $H^\tau$ and
  $H^{-\tau}$ consists of $H(2)^\tau$, the $\tau$-fixed elements
  of order 2. It follows that the component group $F$ may be identified with
  $H(2)^\tau/(H(2)\cap (1-\tau)H)$. Thus $F$ can be represented by a
  subquotient of $H(2)=Y/2Y=(Z/2Z)^n$.

  The larger group $H(2)^\tau$ is computed as the kernel of the action of
  $(1+\tau)$ on $H(2)$, which via the isomorphism $H(2)=(Z/2Z)^n$ means
  the kernel of the reduction mod 2 of the matrix $I+q^t$. The smaller group
  $H(2)\cap (1-\tau)H$ consists of the elements of order 2 in the
  connected group $(H^{-\tau})_0$. It is computed as the reduction mod 2
  of the $-1$ eigenlattice $Y^{-\tau}$ (the latter is the lattice of
  coweights of $(H^{-tau})_0$).

Mathematically this means the complex torus in the complex group, together

precisely, it is a W-conjugacy class of involutive automorphisms.) As the
class is now used in the software, the Cartan involution must be in the inner
class specified by ComplexReductiveGroup. Most of the interesting information
is contained in the two underlying Fiber classes d_fiber and d_dualFiber.
First of all, that is where the Cartan involution lives (since the involution
is needed to define the fibers). But the fiber classes also record for which
real forms this stable conjugacy class of Cartan subgroups is defined; and,
given the real form, which imaginary roots are compact and noncompact.

  \brief Roots simple for the "complex factor" of W^tau.

  The subgroup $W^\tau$ of Weyl group elements commuting with the Cartan
  involution $\tau$ has two obvious (commuting) normal subgroups: the Weyl
  group $W^R$ of the real (that is, fixed by $-\tau$) roots, and the Weyl
  group $W^{iR}$ of the imaginary (that is, fixed by $\tau$) roots. But
  this is not all of $W^\tau$, as is easily seen in the case of complex
  groups, where both $W^R$ and $W^{iR}$ are trivial (there are no real or
  imaginary roots), yet $W$ is a direct sum of two identical factors
  interchanged by $\tau$, and the actions of diagonal elements of that sum
  clearly commute with $\tau$. In general there is a group denoted $W^C
  such that $W^\tau$ is a semidirect product of $W^R * W^{iR}$ (the normal
  subgroup) with $W^C$. Here is how to describe $W^C$.

  Write $RC$ (standing for "complex roots") for the roots orthogonal to both
  the sum of positive real roots, and the sum of positive imaginary roots
  (this group depends on the choice of positive roots, but all choices lead to
  conjugate subgroups). It turns out that $RC$ as a root system is the direct
  sum of two isomorphic root systems $RC_0$ and $RC_1$ interchanged by $\tau$.
  (There is no canonical choice of this decomposition.) Now $W^C$ is the set
  of $\tau$-fixed elements of $W(RC_0) \times W(RC_1)$, in other words its
  diagonal subgroup.

  In general $W^C$ is not the Weyl group of a root subsystem, but it is
  isomorphic the the Weyl group of (any choice of) $RC_0$ (or of $RC_1$). We
  make a choice for $RC_0$, and |d_simpleComplex| lists its simple roots, so
  that $W^C$ is isomorphic to the Weyl group generated by the reflections
  corresponding to the roots whose numbers are in |d_simpleComplex|.

  integer rfc labels an element of Z^delta/[(1+delta)Z], thought of as
  a possible square value for strong real forms. The fiber group acts
  simply transitively on strong real forms with square equal to
  rfc. The integer c labels an orbit of W_i on this fiber group coset;
  this orbit is the equivalence class of strong real forms.
