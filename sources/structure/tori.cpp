        Chapter I -- The RealTorus class

  The real torus class represents the datum of a torus $H$ defined over $R$.
  This is equivalent to the datum of a (character) lattice equipped with an
  involution. To be consistent with the rest of the program, we use the Cartan
  involution $\tau$ which is the negative of the Galois involution on the
  character lattice. A fundamental fact is that the component group of $H(R)$
  (the fixed points of the Galois involution) is canonically isomorphic to the
  component group of the complex group $H(C)^\tau$ fixed under the Cartan
  involution (even thought the initial groups can be of quite different
  dimensions), the latter of which component groups is easy to determine in
  terms of the action of $\tau$ on the character lattice.

  The fundamental data are the rank stored in |d_rank| (allowing us to
  represent the character lattice $X$ as $Z^n$ for $n=d_rank)$, and the
  integral $n*n$ involution matrix |d_involution| giving the action of
  $\tau$ on $X$. It determines two sublattices $X_+$ and $X_-$, cut out by
  its eigenspaces for $+1$ and $-1$ respectively. Both are sublattices are
  saturated, and therefore supplementable in $X$, but in general $X$ is not
  equal to the direct sum $X_+ + X_-$, since that sum need not be saturated
  (for instance in $Z^2$ when $\tau$ interchanges the vectors of a basis).

  The most delicate invariant we shall have to deal with is the component
  group of the real torus $H(R)$. This is an elementary abelian 2-group; we
  shall rather consider its dual group $dpi0(H)$. To describe its rank is
  fairly easy. Indeed, $H$ may be decomposed as a product of compact, split
  and complex factors; this corresponds to a decomposition of $Z^n$ into a
  direct sum of sublattices on which $\tau$ acts respectively as $1$
  (identity), $-1$, and by a permutation of some basis with only 2-cycles.
  While such a decomposition is not canonical, the number of factors of each
  type is uniquely determined; denote them by $r_u$, $r_s$ and $r_c$ (they
  give the ranks of the first two sublattices, and half the rank of the
  third); the rank $n$ of $H$ is equal to $r_u + r_s + 2 r_c$. Then the rank
  of the component group is $r_s$.

  We shall refrain from seeking such a non-canonical decomposition of $X$, and
  work with the subspaces $X_+$ and $X_-$ instead. One has $rk(X_+) = r_u+r_c$
  and $rk(X_-) = r_s+r_c$. Denote V = $X/2X$, a vector space over the
  two-element field $Z/2Z$, and denote by $V_+,V_-$ the respective images of
  $X_+, X_-$ in $V$. Then factors $r_u$ and $r_s$ contribute one-dimensional
  subspaces to $V_+$ and $V_-$, respectively, while a factor $r_c$ contributes
  the _same_ one-dimensional subspace both to $V_+$ and to $V_-$ (since after
  reduction modulo $2$ the is no distinction between the diagonal and
  anti-diagonal subpaces). Therefore on has $r_c = \dim(V_ +\cap V_-)$,
  and it follows that $r_s = rk(X_-) - r_c=\dim(V_-/(V_ \cap V_-))$. It
  can be seen that $V_+ \cap V_-$ is the image of the endomorphism of $V$
  induced by $\tau-1$ (or by $\tau+1$), while $V_+ + V_-$ is the
  kernel of that endomorphism.

  Having used only $X_+$ and $X_-$ we almost have a functorial description of
  the component group of $H(R)$, which is an elementary 2-group isomorphic to
  $V_-/(V_ \cap V_-)$, or equivalently to $(V_+ + V_-)/V_+$. However,
  having started with the weight lattice $X$, the latter groups are actually
  dual objects: $X/2X$ can be interpreted as $Hom(H(2),C^*)$ where $H(2)$
  denotes the set of elements of order 2 (or 1) in $H$. Therefore each of the
  mentioned subquotients naturally models the dual group $dpi0(H)$ of the
  component group of $H(R)$ (or of $H(C)^\tau$). In practice we shall work
  only with these dual groups, and use the subquotient $(V_+ + V_-)/V_+$ to
  represent it (the latter precision is relevant, because even if the two
  subquotients are canonically isomorphic, they cannot be used interchangeably
  in all situations).
