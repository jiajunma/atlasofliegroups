@* Outline.
%
This file describes the central part of the interpreter for the command
language of the Atlas of Lie Groups and Representation software
called \.{realex} (which could be taken to stand for Redesigned
Expression-based Atlas of Lie groups EXecutable). This part is concerned with
the analysis and execution of expressions that have already been processed by
the parser. These are highly recursive processes, and this rather large module
has been limited to those functions that play a part in this recursion. Other
more one-time matters like initialisation and setting global variables that
were originally done in this module have been relegated to a separate
module \.{global.w}.

@ Although initialising the evaluator will be handled in \.{global.w}, we
define a function that resets the evaluator here (since it effectively
functions as destructor, in case of exceptions only, for some values that are
used in this module).

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
void reset_evaluator ();

@~The |execution_stack|, held in a global variable defined in \.{types.w},
owns the values it contains, but there was no reason to wrap it into a class
with a destructor, since we never intend to destroy the stack entirely: if our
program exits either peacefully or by an uncaught exception we don't care
about some values that are not destroyed. We must however remember to empty
the stack after catching a runtime error; since the stack holds |shared_value|
smart pointers, this will automatically |delete| the objects remaining on the
stack. We provide a function to reset the evaluator after catching an
exception that does this, as well as other actions (defined later) needed to
have the evaluator start with a clear slate. We allow monitoring disappearing
values when they are cleared off the stack. As this output may not be easy to
interpret for an unsuspecting user, we limit this to the case that the
|verbosity| variable (defined in \.{global.h}) is nonzero.

@* Outline of the evaluation process.
%
This module is concerned with the processing of the abstract syntax tree as
produced by the parser, ultimately producing actions and computed values. This
processing consist of two separate stages: type analysis, which also
transforms the syntax tree into a more directly executable form, and execution
of those transformed expressions.

The expression returned by the parser, of type |expr|, and the conversion to
the executable format |expression| (a type defined in \.{types.w} as a pointer
to the base class |expression_base|, from which many more specialised classes
will be derived) is performed by the function |convert_expr|. This is a large
and highly recursive function, and a large part of the current module is
dedicated to its definition. The execution of the converted value is performed
by calling the (purely) virtual method |expression_base::evaluate|, so that
the code describing the actual execution of expressions is distributed among
the many definitions of that method in derived classes, and this definition is
only implicitly (mutually) recursive through calls to the
|expression_base::evaluate| method.

@ During type checking, it may happen for certain subexpressions that a
definite type is required for them, while for others nothing is known
beforehand about their type (for instance this is the case for the complete
expression entered by the user for evaluation). The difference is important,
as in the former case conversions can be inserted to make types match, for
instance between a list of integers and a vector value (this is in fact the
only way the user can explicitly construct vector values). However, both
situations (and some intermediate ones) are handled by a single function
|convert_expr|, which in addition builds (upon success) an |expression| value.
As arguments |convert_expr| takes an |expr e@;| value produced by the parser,
and a type in the form of a non-constant reference |type_expr& type@;|. If
|type| is undefined initially, then it will be set to the type derived for the
expression; if it is defined then it may guide the conversion process, and the
type eventually found will have to match it. It could also be that |type| is
initially partially defined (such as `\.{(int,*)}', meaning ``pair on an
integer and something''), in which case derivation and testing functionality
are combined; this gives flexibility to |convert_expr|.

Upon successful completion, |type| will usually have become a completely
defined. The object |type| should be owned by the caller, who will
automatically gain ownership of any new nodes added in the process, and
accessible from |type|. The latter, if it happens, will be caused by calls of
the |specialise| method for |type|, or for its descendants, within
|convert_expr|. In some cases |type| will remain partly undefined, like for an
emtpy list display with an unknown type, which gets specialised only
to~`\.{[*]}'. However if |type| remains completely undefined `\.*' (as will
happen for the selection of a value from an empty list, or would happen for a
function that is recursive without any terminating case if it were possible to
specify such a function in \.{realex}) then it can be seen that evaluation
cannot possibly complete without error, so we might treat this case as a type
error (and we shall do so occasionally if this allows us to simplify our
code).

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
expression convert_expr(const expr& e, type_expr& type)
 @/ throw(std::bad_alloc,program_error);

@ In the function |convert_expr| we shall need a type for storing bindings
between identifiers and types, and this will be the |bindings| class. It uses
a vector of individual bindings, and since a vector cannot hold auto-pointers,
we need to define a destructor to clean up the types. Different such binding
vectors will be stacked, for nested scopes, but using an STL container for
that would necessitate defining a copy constructor, which would be a painful
operation: (1)~it must call |copy| on the types held in the bindings, in order
to avoid double destruction, (2)~these calls to |copy| could throw an
exception, and (3)~the constructor won't be complete, and the destructor
therefore not activated, until the final entry is copied, so we would need a
|try|\dots|catch| in the constructor to avoid a memory leak.

So instead we chain the different bindings into a linked list, and forbid any
copy or assignment. In fact the nesting of the various bindings will embed in
the nested calls of |convert_expr|, so we can afford to allocate each
|bindings| as local variable to (some instance of) |convert_expr|, where links
always point to an instance with larger lifetime. Then there is no ownership
of pointed-to structures at all, the usual handling of the \Cpp call stack
being sufficient. We do provide methods |push| and |pop| to prepend and detach
a |bindings| from a list.

@< Type def... @>=
class bindings
: public std::vector<std::pair<Hash_table::id_type,type_p> >
{ typedef std::vector<std::pair<Hash_table::id_type,type_p> >
    base;
  bindings* next; // non-owned pointer
@)bindings(const bindings&); // copy constructor
  void operator= (const bindings&); // assignment operator
public:
  bindings(size_t n=0) : @[ base() @], next(NULL) @+{@; base::reserve(n); }
    // predict size |n|, informative
  ~bindings () @+
  {@; for (base::iterator it=begin(); it!=end(); ++it)
      delete it->second;
  }
  void add(Hash_table::id_type id,type_ptr t);
  type_p lookup
    (Hash_table::id_type id, size_t& depth, size_t& offset) const;
  void push (bindings*& sp) @+{@; next=sp; sp=this; } // push |*this| onto |sp|
  void pop (bindings*& sp) const @+{@; sp=next; } // pop from |*this| to |sp|
};

@ The method |add| adds a pair to the vector of bindings, taking care not to
release the type pointer until the pair is successfully allocated. This is
also a good place to check for the presence of identical identifiers.

@< Function def... @>=
void bindings::add(Hash_table::id_type id,type_ptr t)
{ for (base::const_iterator it=begin(); it!=end(); ++it)
    if (it->first==id)
      throw program_error(std::string("Multiple binding of ")
                          +main_hash_table->name_of(id)
                          +" in same scope");
  push_back(std::make_pair(id,(type_p)NULL));
  back().second=t.release();
}

@ The method |lookup| runs through the linked list of bindings and returns a
pointer to the type if a match for the identifier |id| was found, also
assigning the coordinates to output arguments. If no match is found a null
pointer is returned and the output parameters are unchanged.

@< Function def... @>=
type_p bindings::lookup
  (Hash_table::id_type id, size_t& depth, size_t& offset) const
{ size_t i=0;
  for (const bindings* p=this; p!=NULL; p=p->next,++i)
    for (size_t j=0; j<p->size(); ++j)
      if ((*p)[j].first==id)
      {@; depth=i; offset=j; return (*p)[j].second; }
  return NULL;
}

@ During conversion of expressions, we keep a stack |id_context| of identifier
bindings in order to detemine their (lexical) binding and type. We could have
passed this context as an argument to |convert_expr|, but it changes only on
very few occasions, so it is more convenient to use a static variable to hold
the context. This variable could have been |static| local to the function
|convert_expr|, if it were not for the fact that conversion could be aborted by
throwing an exception during type analysis, in which case all active
invocations of |convert_expr| will be terminated, and unless we were willing
to add a |catch| clause at every change to |id_context|, we would have no
occasion to clear the context for the next type analysis. So we decide to
declare this variable local to this compilation unit, and provide a separate
action for clearing it.

@< Local var... @>=
bindings* id_context;

@~The cleaning up action just clears the pointer; in fact the pointed to
objects have already disappeared from the \Cpp\ runtime stack at the time this
code gets executed.

@< Actions to reset the evaluator @>=
id_context=NULL;

@ The function |convert_expr| returns a pointer to the conversion of the
|expr| to |expression|, of which the caller should take ownership. The reason
we don't return an |expression_ptr| is entirely pragmatic: there are many
return statements in this function, and ensuring conversion to an auto-pointer
before return would be somewhat laborious, whereas the conversion can be
easily and safely achieved by the caller; also sometimes the resulting pointer
is stored in a data structure that cannot accommodate auto-pointers.

Altogether this is a quite extensive function, with as many cases in the
switch as there are variants of |expr_union|, and for many of those branches a
considerable amount of work to be done. It is therefore convenient to postpone
these cases and treat them one syntactic construction at the time.

@< Function definitions @>=
expression convert_expr(const expr& e, type_expr& type)
@/  throw(std::bad_alloc,program_error)
{
  switch(e.kind)
  {
   @\@< Cases for type-checking and converting expression~|e| against
   |type|, all of which either |return| or |throw| a |type_error| @>
  }
  return NULL; // keep compiler happy
}

@* Denotations.
%
Let us define a first class derived from |expression_base|, which is
|denotation|; it simply stores a |value|, which it returns upon evaluation.
The constructor is passed a smart pointer for the usual reason: if the
constructor should be part of a |new| expression (as is practice it will) then
the allocation for that |new| happens between the moment of passing the
constructor arguments and the invocation of the constructor, and if that
allocation throws it would produce a memory leak if raw a pointer were passed.
This does force us to cast the arguments to |shared_value| below.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct denotation : public expression_base
{ shared_value denoted_value;
@)
  explicit denotation(shared_value v) : denoted_value(v) @+{}
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const
  @+{@; denoted_value->print(out); }
};

@ Since the |denotation| object stores a (constant, shared) value inside it,
the evaluation simply consists of copying the pointer to the
|execution_stack|. In spite of this simplicity, the |evaluate| is not defined
inside the class definition, because that definition precedes the one of the
|inline| function |push_value| in the header file. The method is not even made
|inline|, since there is little point in doing so for virtual methods (calls
via the vtable cannot be inlined). For the first time we see the |level|
argument in action; whenever |l==no_value| we should avoid producing a result
value.

@< Function def... @>=
void denotation::evaluate(level l) const
@+{@; if (l!=no_value) push_value(denoted_value); }

@ Here are the first examples of the conversions done in |convert_expr|. Each
time we extract a \Cpp\ value from the |expr e@;| returned by the parser,
construct and |new|-allocate a \.{realex} value (for instance |int_value|)
from it, get a smart pointer to it, and pass that to the |denotation|
constructor

The code below takes into account the possibility that a denotation is
converted immediately to some other type, for instance integer denotations can
be used where a rational number is expected. The function |conform_types|
(defined in \.{types.w}) will test whether the denotation provides or can be
converted to the required type, and may modify its final argument in the
latter case.

@< Cases for type-checking and converting... @>=
case integer_denotation:
  { expression_ptr d@|(new denotation
      (shared_value(new int_value(e.e.int_denotation_variant))));
    return conform_types(int_type,type,d,e);
  }
case string_denotation:
  { expression_ptr d@|(new denotation
      (shared_value(new string_value(e.e.str_denotation_variant))));
    return conform_types(str_type,type,d,e);
  }
case boolean_denotation:
  { expression_ptr d@|(new denotation
        (shared_value(new bool_value(e.e.int_denotation_variant))));
    return conform_types(bool_type,type,d,e);
  }

@ We allow using the last value computed to be used in an expression, using
the symbol `\.\$'.

@< Declarations of global variables @>=
extern type_ptr last_type;
extern shared_value last_value;

@~We set the pointers to |NULL| here, but the |main| function will give them
more appropriate starting values.

@< Global variable definitions @>=
type_ptr last_type;
shared_value last_value;

@ Upon parsing `\.\$', and |expr| value with |kind==last_value_computed| is
transmitted. Upon type-checking we capture the value in a |denotation|
structure, which may or may not be evaluated soon after; even if the value
gets captured in a function value, it will remain immutable.

@< Cases for type-checking and converting... @>=
case last_value_computed:
  { expression_ptr d@|(new denotation(last_value));
    return conform_types(*last_type,type,d,e);
  }


@* List displays.
%
Now we shall consider the handling of list displays, expressions that build a
list of values by constructing each component by an explicit expression. We
start by defining the structure used to represent list displays after
conversion in the type check. The logical name |list_display| for this
structure is already taken, so we call it a |list_expression| instead.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct list_expression : public expression_base
{ std::vector<expression> component;
@)
  explicit list_expression(size_t n) : component(n,NULL) @+{}
   // always start out with null pointers
  virtual ~list_expression();
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const;
  typedef std::vector<expression>::const_iterator c_it; // for commodity
};

@ A |list_expression| owns its component expressions, so the destructor must
take care to delete them.

@< Function def... @>=
list_expression::~list_expression()
{@; for (c_it it=component.begin(); it!=component.end(); ++it) delete(*it); }

@ When we print a list display, we just print the component expressions,
enclosed in brackets and separated by commas, just as in their input syntax.

@< Function def... @>=
void list_expression::print(std::ostream& out) const
{ out << '[';
  if (component.size()==0) out << ']';
  else
    for (c_it it=component.begin(); it!=component.end(); ++it)
      out << **it << (it+1!=component.end() ? ',' : ']');
}


@ If a list display has multiple components, they must all have the same
type~$t$, and the result type will be ``row of''~$t$. If a type of that form
is required, the components will be required to have type $t$, if no
particular type is required then the components will just be required to have
equal types; in addition we want to allow additional cases which can be made
to conform by inserting conversion routines.

The function |convert_expr| handles all this in a fairly effortless way. As we
proceed along the components, the type |*type.component_type|, may get
specialised if undefined initially, and once this is the case further
components may be coerced into the previously established component type. It
may even happen that the type remains partly undetermined, in case of an empty
list. The current code does have a slight asymmetry, in that types from
previous components may guide conversions applied to later components but not
vice versa: if some components are vectors and other are lists of integers,
then everything will be converted to the first kind that occurs (unless the
context requires a particular type, in which case all components are converted
accordingly).

We also have the obligation here to build a converted |list_expression|
representing the list display; we know its size beforehand, and reserve that
space, but let the vector start out empty, pushing completed |expression|
pointers into it whenever |convert_expr| has converted a subexpression; this
ensures proper destruction in case a |type_error| is thrown by a component
expression. When a type other than ``row of'' is expected, we must instead
take explicit action to see whether some type conversion can resolve the
conflict.

@< Cases for type-checking and converting... @>=
case list_display:
  if (type.specialise(row_of_type))
  { std::auto_ptr<list_expression> result (new list_expression(0));
    result->component.reserve(length(e.e.sublist));
    for (expr_list l=e.e.sublist; l!=NULL; l=l->next)
      result->component.push_back(convert_expr(l->e,*type.component_type));
    return result.release(); // and convert (derived|->|base) to |expression|
  }
  else
  @< If |type| can be converted from some row-of type, check the components of
     |e.e.sublist| against the required type, and apply a conversion function
     to the converted expression; otherwise |throw| a |type_error| @>

@ When in |convert_expr| we encounter a list display when a non-row type is
expected, we single out the cases that a conversion from a row type to the
required type is available; this conversion is searched for by |row_coercion|
(defined in \.{types.w}). If this is successful, we continue to convert the
component expressions with as expected type the corresponding component type
(if multiple coercions to the required type are known, |row_coercion| gives
preference to the first one in the table; this occurs for required
type \.{mat}, and means that the component type will then be \.{vec} rather
than \.{[int]}). Once a conversion has been determined, we proceed as in the
case where as ``row-of'' type was required, and in particular there may be
further coercions of individual expressions in the list display.

@< If |type| can be converted from some row-of type, check the components of
   |e.e.sublist|... @>=
{ type_expr comp_type;
  const conversion_record* conv = row_coercion(type,comp_type);
  if (conv==NULL)
    throw type_error(e,copy(row_of_type),copy(type));
@)
  std::auto_ptr<list_expression> display@|
      (new list_expression(0));
  display->component.reserve(length(e.e.sublist));
  for (expr_list l=e.e.sublist; l!=NULL; l=l->next)
    display->component.push_back(convert_expr(l->e,comp_type));
  return new conversion(*conv,expression_ptr(display));
}

@ The evaluation of a |list_expression| evaluates the components in a simple
loop. If |l==no_value|, we only evaluate for side effects, otherwise we wrap
the result in a single |row_value|. Since evaluation of component expressions
pushes the resulting value onto the execution stack, we pop each one off
immediately to integrate it into the result. We take care to hold the partial
result via an auto-pointer |result|, so that in case of a runtime error during
the evaluation of one of the component expressions the values already computed
are cleaned up.

@< Function def... @>=
void list_expression::evaluate(level l) const
{ if (l==no_value)
    for (c_it it=component.begin(); it!=component.end(); ++it)
      (*it)->void_eval();
  else
  { row_ptr result(new row_value(0)); result->val.reserve(component.size());
    for (c_it it=component.begin(); it!=component.end(); ++it)
      (*it)->eval(),result->val.push_back(pop_value());
    push_value(result); // result will be shared from here on
  }
}

@* Tuples.
%
Besides types for uniform sequences we shall need types for non-uniform
sequences of values, usually short and with a given sequence of types for
their components; their most obvious and simple use is for argument lists of
functions. Without using these tuple types one might define function types
taking multiple arguments, but then a function could still only yield a single
value. With tuple types multiple results can be produced, and there will be no
need to explicitly cater for functions with multiple arguments.

@*1 Tuple displays.
%
Tuple values can be produced by tuple displays. Syntactically these are very
much like list displays, listing explicitly their component expressions. After
type-checking, they are represented by a |tuple_expression| object (the
name |tuple_display| was already taken); we derive this from
|list_expression|.


@< Type definitions @>=
struct tuple_expression : public list_expression
{ explicit tuple_expression(size_t n) : list_expression(n)@+{}
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const;
};

@ When we print a tuple display, we just print the component expressions,
enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas, to match their input syntax.


@< Function def... @>=
void tuple_expression::print(std::ostream& out) const
{ out << '(';
  if (component.size()==0) out << ')';
  else
    for (c_it it=component.begin(); it!=component.end(); ++it)
      out << **it << (it+1!=component.end() ? ',' : ')');
}


@ When converting a tuple expression, we first try to specialise |type| to a
tuple type with the right number of unknown components; unless |type| was
completely undetermined, this just amounts to a test that it is a tuple type
with the right number of components. Even if the specialisation fails, it need
not be a type error: the tuple mights be convertible to the proper type. For
this reason continue to type-check components even when |tuple_expected| is
false, using the a priori (tuple) type found as starting point for a possible
coercion. In this case we already know that |type| cannot be specialised to
|*tup|, so we call |coerce| directly rather than using |conform_types| as
happens elsewhere. If we do find a type error due to a wrong number of
components, this is reported via a type pattern; this is probably as clear as
mentioning too few or too many components explicitly.

@< Cases for type-checking and converting... @>=
case tuple_display:
{ type_ptr tup=unknown_tuple(length(e.e.sublist));
  bool tuple_expected=type.specialise(*tup);
    // whether |type| is a tuple of correct size
  tuple_expression* tup_exp;
  expression_ptr result(tup_exp=new tuple_expression(0));
  tup_exp->component.reserve(length(e.e.sublist));
  type_list tl= tuple_expected ? type.tuple : tup->tuple;
  for (expr_list el=e.e.sublist; el!=NULL; el=el->next,tl=tl->next)
    tup_exp->component.push_back(convert_expr(el->e,tl->t));
  if (tuple_expected)
    return result.release();  // and convert (derived|->|base) to |expression|
  else if (coerce(*tup,type,result))
    return result.release();
  else throw type_error(e,copy(*tup),copy(type));
}

@*1 Evaluating tuple displays.
%
Evaluating a tuple display is much like evaluating a list display: we evaluate
the components in a simple loop. If |l==no_value| this is done for side
effects only, otherwise each component produces (via the |eval| method) a
single value on the stack. Afterwards the result needs to be grouped into a
single value only if |l==single_value|, which is accomplished by |wrap_tuple|.

@< Function def... @>=
void tuple_expression::evaluate(level l) const
{ if (l==no_value)
    for (c_it it=component.begin(); it!=component.end(); ++it)
      (*it)->void_eval();
  else
  { for (c_it it=component.begin(); it!=component.end(); ++it)
      (*it)->eval();
    if (l==single_value)
      wrap_tuple(component.size());
  }
}

@* Array subscription.
%
While we have seen expressions to build lists, and although vectors and
matrices can be made out of them using coercions, we so far are not able to
access their components once they are constructed. To that end we shall now
introduce operations to index such values. We allow subscription of rows, but
also of vectors, rational vectors, matrices, and strings. Since after type
analysis we know which of the cases applies for a given expression, we define
several classes among which type analysis will choose. These classes differ
mostly by their |evaluate| method, so we first derive an intermediate class
from |expression_base|, and derive the others from it. This class also serves
to host an enumeration type that will serve later. We include a case here,
|mod_poly_term|, that is related to a type defined in \.{built-in-types}.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct subscr_base : public expression_base
{ enum sub_type
  { row_entry, vector_entry, ratvec_entry, string_char
  , matrix_entry, matrix_column, mod_poly_term };
  expression array, index; // the two parts of the subscription expression
@)
  subscr_base(expression_ptr a, expression_ptr i)
  : array(a.release()),index(i.release()) @+{}
  ~subscr_base() @+ {@; delete array; delete index; }
  void print(std::ostream& out) const;
  static bool indexable
  (const type_expr& aggr,
   const type_expr& index,
         type_expr& subscr,
         sub_type& kind);
  static bool assignable(sub_type);

@ These subscriptions are printed in the usual subscription syntax. For matrix
subscriptions, where the index type is \.{(int,int)}, the index expression is
quite likely to be a tuple display, in which case we suppress parentheses.

@ When encountering a subscription in |convert_expr|, we determine the types
of array and of the indexing expression separately, ignoring so far any type
required by the context. Then we look if the types agree with any of the types
of subscription expressions that we can convert to, throwing an error if it
does not. Finally we check is the a priori type |subscr_type| of the
subscripted expression equals or specialises to the required |type|, or can be
converted to it by |coerce|, again throwing an error if nothing works. For the
indexing expression only equality of types is admitted, since the basic
language has no conversions that could apply, and if an extension does provide
some (indeed we shall later a add conversion from split integer to pair of
integers), we would not want to apply them implicitly in index positions. Also
there is little point in catering for (indexing) expressions having completely
undetermined type, as such a type can only apply to an expression that can
never return (it cannot be evaluated without error).

@* Identifiers.
%
Calling functions, whether built-in or user-defined, requires using
identifiers, but they occur in other contexts as well, and their treatment is
no different between these cases. They come in two kinds, local and global
identifiers, which are treated in fairly different way, and during type
analysis the two are converted into different kinds of |expression|. The most
fundamental difference is that for global identifiers a value is already known
at the time the identifier expression is type-checked, and the type of this
value can be used; for local identifiers only a type is associated to the
identifier at that time, and indeed during different evaluations the same
local identifier may find itself bound to different values.

Global identifiers values will be stored in a global identifier table holding
values and their types. The values of local identifiers will be stored at
runtime in a stack of variable bindings, but not their types (these are held
elsewhere during type analysis, and have disappeared at evaluation time).

In spite of these differences there is some common ground for global and local
identifiers: they have a name that can be printed. For this reason we derive
an intermediate structure from |expression_base| that will serve as base for
both kinds of applied identifier expressions.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct identifier : public expression_base
{ Hash_table::id_type code;
@)
  explicit identifier(Hash_table::id_type id) : code(id) @+{}
  virtual ~identifier() @+ {}
  const char* name() const;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const;
};

@ To print an identifier, we get its name from the main hash table.

@< Function definitions @>=
const char* identifier::name() const
@+{@; return main_hash_table->name_of(code); }
void identifier::print(std::ostream& out) const
@+{@; out<< name(); }

@*1 The global identifier table.
%
We need an identifier table to record the values of globally bound identifiers
(such as those for built-in functions) and their types. The values are held in
shared pointers, so that we can evaluate a global identifier without
duplicating the value in the table itself. Modifying the value of such an
identifier by an assignment will produce a new pointer, so that
``shareholders'' of the old value will not see any change. There is another
level of sharing, which affects applied occurrences of the identifier as
converted during type analysis. The value accessed by such identifiers (which
could be contained in user-defined function bodies and therefore have long
lifetime) are expected to undergo change when a new value is assigned to the
global variable; they will therefore access the location of the shared value
pointer rather than the value pointed to. However, if a new identifier of the
same name should be introduced, a new value pointer stored in a different
location will be created, while existing applied occurrences of the identifier
will continue to access the old value, avoiding the possibility of accessing a
value of unexpected type. In such a circumstance, the old shared pointer
location itself will no longer be owned by the identifier table, so we should
arrange for shared ownership of that location. This explains that the
|id_data| structure used for entries in the table has a shared pointer to a
shared pointer.

For the type component on the other hand, the identifier table will assume
strict ownership. If one would instead give ownership of the |type| field
directly to individual |id_data| entries, this would greatly complicate their
duplication, and therefore their insertion into the table. We therefore only
allow construction of |id_data| objects in an empty state; the pointers they
contain should be set only \emph{after} the insertion of the object into the
table, which then immediately assumes ownership of the type.

@< Type definitions @>=

typedef std::tr1::shared_ptr<shared_value> shared_share;
struct id_data
{ shared_share val; @+ type_p type;
  id_data() : val(),type(NULL)@+ {}
};

@ We cannot store auto pointers in a table, so upon entering into the table we
convert type pointers to ordinary pointers, and this is what |type_of| lookup
will return (the table retains ownership); destruction of the type expressions
referred to will be handled explicitly when the entry, or the table itself, is
destructed.

@< Includes needed in the header file @>=

the identifier as key is used.

@ The method |add| tries to insert the new mapping from the key |id| to a new
value-type pair. Doing so, it must distinguish two cases. It tentatively
inserts a new empty entry for the identifier into the table; this returns a
pair with a second boolean component telling whether a new entry was added
(the identifier was unknown as global identifier). If this is the case, we
continue to fill the slot with a newly allocated shared pointer and the
provided type. If the identifier was already present, we abandon the old
shared pointer location, resetting the pointer to it to point to a newly
allocated one, destroy the old type and insert the new type. All in all, the
only difference in the code of the two branches is the deletion of the old
type.

  }
  else
  {@; slot.val.reset(new shared_value(val));
    delete slot.type;
    slot.type=type.release();
  }

{ map_type::iterator p = table.find(id);

}

@ In order to have |const| lookup methods, we must refrain from inserting into
the table if the key is not found; we return a null pointer in that case. The

immediately modify the table, |address_of| is classified as a manipulator,

@*1 Global identifiers.
%
When during type checking an identifiers binds to a value in the global
identifier table, it will be converted into a |global_identifier| object.
Since a value is already available at this time, we can record the location of
the (pointer to the shared) value in the |global_identifier| object. Apart
from avoiding look-up at evaluation time, this binding can remain intact in
case the global identifier should be defined anew using the |add| method of
the identifier table, and will continue to access the old value. This
precaution is necessary because (in contrast to assignment) a new definition
may change the type of the identifier, but the applied identifier expression
has already been type-checked and should not be allowed to return a value of a
different type than it did originally.

@< Type definitions @>=
class global_identifier : public identifier
{ const shared_share address;
public:
  explicit global_identifier(Hash_table::id_type id);
  virtual ~global_identifier() @+ {}
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;

@ Evaluating a global identifier returns the value currently stored in the
location |address|, possibly expanded if |l==multi_value|, or nothing at all
if |l==no_value|. However, since undefined global variables have been made

|*address|.

@< Function definitions @>=
void global_identifier::evaluate(level l) const

    o << "Taking value of uninitialized variable " << name();
    throw std::runtime_error(o.str());
  }
  push_expanded(l,*address);
}

@*1 Local identifiers.
%
Local identifiers will be accessed from the current execution context, which
is a stack of variable bindings independent of the |execution_stack| (the
latter bieng used for anonymous components of expressions being evaluated).
This stack is implemented as a singly linked list, and accessed through a
(smart) pointer. The structure |context| pointed to by |context_ptr| is
described in \.{types.w}; essentially, each node of the list is a vector of
values that, although each is associated with an identifier, are stored
anonymously; the proper location of a variable in this list of frames will
determined during type checking and stored, so that no looking up is required
at run time (although traversing of the linked list may be necessary).

The pointer |context_ptr| is declared a as static variable local to the
evaluator; compared with making it a parameter to the |evaluate| methods, this
has the advantage of not encumbering the numerous such methods that neither
use nor modify the context in any way (those not involving identifiers or user
defined functions).

@< Local var... @>=
context_ptr execution_context;

@~A disadvantege of using a static variable |context_ptr| is that in case of
exceptions it retains the value current before throwing. Therefore we need to
explicitly reset the execution in such cases. Since it is a smart pointer,
resetting automatically takes care of adjusting reference counts and maybe
deleting values that are part of the discarded context.

@< Actions... @>=
execution_context.reset();

@ We derive the class of local identifiers from that of global ones, which
takes care of its |print| method. The data stored are |depth| identifying a
frame, and |offset| locating the proper values withing the frame.

@< Type definitions @>=
class local_identifier : public identifier
{ size_t depth, offset;
public:
  explicit local_identifier(Hash_table::id_type id, size_t i, size_t j)
     : identifier(id), depth(i), offset(j) @+{}
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const; // only this method is redefined
};

@ The method |local_identifier::evaluate| looks up a value in the current
|execution_context|, which the method |context::elem| accomplishes.

@< Function definitions @>=
void local_identifier::evaluate(level l) const
{@; push_expanded(l,execution_context->elem(depth,offset)); }

@ When type-checking an applied identifier, we first look in |id_context| for
a binding of the identifier; if found it will be a local identifier, and
otherwise we look in |global_id_table|. If found in either way, the associated
type must equal the expected type (if any), or be convertible to it using
|coerce|. There is a subtlety in that the identifier may have a more general
type than |type| required by the context (for instance if it was \&{let} equal
to an empty list, and a concrete type of list is required). In this case the
first call of |specialise| below succeeds without modifying |type|, and we
then specialise the identifier to |type| instead, so that it cannot be
subsequently used with an incompatible specialisation (notably any further
assignments to the variable must respect the more specific type).

@< Cases for type-checking and converting... @>=
case applied_identifier:
{ type_p id_t; expression_ptr id; size_t i,j;
  if ((id_t=id_context->lookup(e.e.identifier_variant,i,j))!=NULL)

  else if ((id_t=global_id_table->type_of(e.e.identifier_variant))!=NULL)
    id.reset(new global_identifier(e.e.identifier_variant));
  else throw program_error  @|

    return id.release();
  else throw type_error(e,copy(*id_t),copy(type));
}

@*1 Operator and function overloading.
%
While the simple mechanism of identifier identification given above suffices
for many purposes, it would be very restrictive in case of operators (since it
allows only one function, with fixed argument types, to be bound globally to
an operator symbol identifier), and to a somewhat lesser measure (since one
could vary the identifier name according to the argument types) for functions.
So we definitely want to allow operator overloading (defining the same
operator for different combinations of argument types), and with such a
mechanism in place, it is easy to allow function overloading as well, which
will for instance allow the intuitive convention of simply naming built-in
functions after the mathematical meaning of the result they compute, even if
such a result can be computed from different sets of input data.

To implement overloading we use a similar structure as the ordinary global
identifier table. However the basic table entry for an overloading needs a
level of sharing less, since the function bound for given argument types
cannot be changed by assignment, so the call will refer directly to the value
stored rather than to its location. We also take into account that the stored
types are always function types, so that we can store a |func_type| structure
without tag or pointer to it. This saves space, although it makes  access the
full function type as a |type_expr| rather difficult; however the latter is
seldom needed in normal use. Remarks about ownership of the type
apply without change from the non-overloaded case however.

@< Type definitions @>=

struct overload_data
{ shared_value val; @+ func_type_p type;
  overload_data() : val(),type(NULL)@+ {}
};

@*2 Overload tables.
%
Looking up an overloaded identifier should given an ordered list of possible
overloads, the ordering being important since we want to try matching more
specific (harder to convert to) argument types before trying less specific
ones. Therefore, rather than using a |std::multimap| multi-mapping identifiers
to individual value-type pairs, we use a |std::map| from identifiers to
vectors of value-type pairs.

An identifier is entered into the table when it is first given an overloaded
definition, so the table will not normally associate an empty vector to an
identifier; however this situation can arise after removal of a (last)
definition for an identifier. The |variants| method will signal absence of an
identifier by returning an empty list of variants, and no separate test for
this condition is provided.

@ The |variants| method just returns a reference to the found vector of

@ The |add| method is what introduces and controls overloading. We first try
to associate a singleton vector with the identifier, and upon success insert
the given value-type pair. In the contrary case (the identifier already had a
vector associate to it), we must test the new pair against existing elements,
reject it if there is a conflicting entry present, and otherwise make sure it
is inserted before any strictly less specific overloaded instances.

@ We call |is_close| for each existing argument type; if it returns a nonzero
value it must be either |0x6|, in which case insertion must be after that
entry, or |0x5|, in which case insertion must be no later than at this
position, so that the entry in question (after shifting forward) stays ahead.
The last of the former cases and the first of the latter are recorded, and
their requirements should be compatible.

Although the module name does not mention it, we allow one case of close and
mutually convertible types, namely identical types; in this case we simply
replace the old definition for this type by the new one. This could still
change the result type, but that does not matter because if any calls that
were type-checked against the old definition should survive (in a closure),
they have been also bound to the (function) \emph{value} that was previously
accessed by that definition, and will continue to use it; their operation is
in no way altered by the replacement of the definition.

  }
  @< Insert |val| and |type| after |lwb| and before |upb| @>
}

@ We get here when the argument types to be added are either mutually
convertible but distinct form existing types (the fall through case above), or
close to existing types without being convertible in any direction (which
would have given a way to disambiguate), so we must report an error. The error
message is quite verbose, but tries to precisely pinpoint the kind of problem
encountered so that the user will hopefully able to understand.

@< Report conflict of attempted overload for |id| with previous one in

}

@ Once we arrive here, the value of |lwb| indicates the first position in
|slot| where we could insert our overload (after any narrower match, and |upb|
indicates the last possible position (before any broader match). It should not
be possible (by transitivity of convertibility) that any narrower match comes
after any broader match, so we insist that |lwb>upb| always, and throw a
|std::logic_error| in case it should fail. Having passed this test, we insert
the new overload into the vector |slot| at position |upb|, the last possible
one.

Shifting entries during a call of |insert| may temporarily create duplicated
(non-smart) type pointers at some points; however these do not risk double
deletion since no errors can be thrown at such points. Indeed, the only point
where throwing may occur is when extending the vector which happens at the
very beginning. We note also that in case of necessary reallocation, entries
will be copied (and temporarily duplicated) anyway; the |variant_list::insert|
method we are calling here does nothing more dangerous than that.

}


@ The |remove| method allows removing an entry from the overload table, for
instance to make place for another one. It returns a Boolean telling whether
any such binding was found (and removed). The |variants| array might become
empty, but remains present and will be reused upon future additions.

@*2 Resolution of overloading.
%
We shall call |resolve_overload| from the case for function applications in
|convert_expr|, after testing that overloads exist. So we can pass the
relevant |variants| as a parameter.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
expression resolve_overload
  (const expr& e,
   type_expr& type,
   const overload_table::variant_list& variants);

@~To resolve overloading, we used to plunge into each variant, catching and
ignoring errors, until one succeeded without error. For long formulae this
caused traversing a search tree of exponential size, giving unacceptably
inefficient expression analysis. So instead we now first try to find a
matching variant, using an \foreign{a priori} type of the operand(s). This
implies that the operand must be correctly typed without the benefit of a
known result type, but the type found need not be an exact match with the one
specified in the variant. Our matching condition is that |is_close| should
hold, with the bit set that indicates a possible conversion from
|a_priori_type| to the operand type for which the variant is defined.
Coercions may need to be inserted in the operand expression, and since that
expression could be arbitrarily complex, inserting coercions explicitly after
the fact would be very hard to program. We choose the easier approach to cast
away the converted expression once the matching variant is found, and to redo
the analysis with the now known result type so that coercions get inserted
during conversion. But then we again risk exponential time (although with
powers of~2 rather than powers of the number of variants); since probably
coercions will not be needed at all levels, we mitigate this risk by not
redoing any work in case of an exact match.

Apart from those in |variants|, we also test for certain argument types that
will match without being in any table; for instance the size-of operator~`\#'
can be applied to any row type to give its number of components. Being more
generic bindings, we test for them after the more specific ones fail. The
details of these cases, like those of the actual construction of a call for a
matching overloaded function, will be given later.

@< Function definitions @>=
expression resolve_overload
  (const expr& e,
   type_expr& type,
   const overload_table::variant_list& variants)
{ const expr& args = e.e.call_variant->arg;
  type_expr a_priori_type;
  expression_ptr arg(convert_expr(args,a_priori_type));
    // get \foreign{a priori} types once
  Hash_table::id_type id =  e.e.call_variant->fun.e.identifier_variant;
  @< If |id| is a special operator like size-of and it matches
  |a_priori_type|, |return| a call |id(args)| @>
  for (size_t i=0; i<variants.size(); ++i)
  { const overload_data& v=variants[i];
    if ((is_close(a_priori_type,v.type->arg_type)&0x1)!=0)
      // could first convert to second?
    { if (a_priori_type!=v.type->arg_type)
        arg=expression_ptr(convert_expr(args,v.type->arg_type));
          // redo conversion
      @< Return a call of variant |v| with argument |arg|, or |throw| if
         result type mismatches |type| @>
    }
  }

  @< Complain about failing overload resolution @>
}

@ Failing overload resolution causes a |expr_error| explaining the is matching
identifier and type. As most function definitions will be in the overload
table even if only one definition is present, we produce a more specific
|type_error| in that case, whose message will mention the unique
expected argument type.

@< Complain about failing overload resolution @>=
if (variants.size()==1)
  throw type_error(args,copy(a_priori_type),copy(variants[0].type->arg_type));
else
{ std::ostringstream o;
  o << "Failed to match `"

  throw expr_error(e,o.str());
}

@* Function calls.
%
One of the most basic and important tasks of the evaluator is to allow
function calls, which may involve either built-in or user-defined functions.
This central part of the evaluator will be presented with an initial focus on
built-in functions, while leaving the particulars of user defined functions
(also known as $\lambda$-expressions) and their evaluation aside until
somewhat later. This corresponds somewhat to the development history of the
interpreter, in which initially only built-in functions were catered for;
however many of the aspects that we deal with right away, notably function
overloading, are in fact much more recent additions than used-defined
functions were.

We start with introducing a type for representing general function calls after
type checking. This is the general form where function can be given by any
kind of expression, not necessarily an applied identifier; indeed most cases
where a named function is called will handled by another kind of expression,
the overloaded call. In contrast with that, this type of call will dynamically
evaluate the function expression, possibly resulting in different functions
between evaluations.

@< Type def... @>=
struct call_expression : public expression_base
{ expression function, argument;
@)
  call_expression(expression_ptr f,expression_ptr a)
   : function(f.release()),argument(a.release()) @+{}
  virtual ~call_expression() @+ {@; delete function; delete argument; }
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const;
};

@ To print a function call we print the function expression, enclosed in
parentheses unless it is an identifier, and the argument, enclosed in
parentheses unless it is a tuple expression (which already has parentheses).
The conditions for suppressing parentheses are tested a dynamic casts.

@< Function definitions @>=
void call_expression::print(std::ostream& out) const
{ if (dynamic_cast<identifier*>(function)!=NULL) out << *function;
  else out << '(' << *function << ')';
  if (dynamic_cast<tuple_expression*>(argument)!=NULL) out << *argument;
  else out << '(' << *argument << ')';
}

@ When a call involves a built-in function, what is executed is a ``wrapper
function'', defined in \.{global.h}.

@< Includes needed in the header file @>=

#include "global.h" // for |wrapper_function|

@ The class of dynamic values holding a wrapper function is called
|builtin_value|; it also stores a print name, which is used when the wrapper
function, rather than being called, gets printed as (part of) a value in its
own right.

@< Type definitions @>=

struct builtin_value : public value_base
{ wrapper_function val;
  std::string print_name;
@)
  builtin_value(wrapper_function v,const std::string& n)
  : val(v), print_name(n) @+ {}
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const
  @+{@; out << '{' << print_name << '}'; }
  builtin_value* clone() const @+{@; return new builtin_value(*this); }
  static const char* name() @+{@; return "built-in function"; }
private:
  builtin_value(const builtin_value& v)
  : val(v.val), print_name(v.print_name)
  @+{}
};

@ While syntactically more complicated than ordinary function calls, the call
of overloaded functions is actually simpler at run time, because the function
is necessarily referred to by an identifier instead of by an arbitrary
expression, and overloading resolution results in a function \emph{value}
rather than in the description of a location where the function can be found
at run time. If that value happens to be a built-in function, the call will be
translated into an |overloaded_builtin_call| rather than into a
|call_expression|.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct overloaded_builtin_call : public expression_base
{ wrapper_function f;
  std::string print_name;
  expression argument;
@)
  overloaded_builtin_call(wrapper_function v,const char* n,expression_ptr a)
  : f(v), print_name(n), argument(a.release())@+ {}
  virtual ~overloaded_builtin_call() @+ {@; delete argument; }
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const;
};

@ When printing, we ignore the stored wrapper function (which does not record
its name) and use the overloaded function name; otherwise we proceed as for
general function calls with an identifier as function.

@< Function definitions @>=
void overloaded_builtin_call::print(std::ostream& out) const
{ out << print_name;
  if (dynamic_cast<tuple_expression*>(argument)!=NULL) out << *argument;
  else out << '(' << *argument << ')';
}

@ Some built-in functions like |print| accept arguments of any types, and in
particular tuples of any length. For such functions we cannot adopt the method
used for other built-in functions of expanding argument tuples on the stack,
since there would then be no way to recover their number. Fortunately such
functions are necessarily accessed through overloading, so we detect the fact
that they are being used at analysis time. This fact is then recorded it in
the type of call expression generated, and the |evaluate| method will ask for
an unexpanded argument on the execution stack. Therefore we derive a type from
|overloaded_builtin_call| that will override only the |evaluate| method.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct generic_builtin_call : public overloaded_builtin_call
{ typedef overloaded_builtin_call base;
@)
  generic_builtin_call(wrapper_function v,const char* n,expression_ptr a)
  : base(v,n,a)@+ {}
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
};

@*1 Type-checking function calls.
%
When we type-check a function call, we must expect the function part to be any
type of expression. However, when it is a single identifier (possibly operator
symbol) that is not locally bound, and for which overloads are defined, then
we attempt overload resolution (and in this case we ignore any value possibly
present in the global identifier table). In all other cases, the function
expression determines its own type, and once this is known, its argument and
result types can be used to help converting the argument expression and the
call expression itself. Thus in such cases we first get the type of the
expression in the function position, requiring only that it be a function
type, then type-check and convert the argument expression using the obtained
result type, and build a converted function call~|call|. Finally (and this is
done by |conform_types|) we test if the required type matches the return type
(in which case we simply return~|call|), or if the return type can be coerced
to it (in which case we return |call| as transformed by |coerce|); if neither
is possible we throw a~|type_error|.

@< Cases for type-checking and converting... @>=
case function_call:
{ if (e.e.call_variant->fun.kind==applied_identifier)
    @< Convert and |return| an overloaded function call if
    |e.e.call_variant->fun| is not a local identifier and is known in
    |global_overload_table| @>
  type_ptr f_type=copy(gen_func_type); // start with generic function type
  expression_ptr fun(convert_expr(e.e.call_variant->fun,*f_type));
  expression_ptr arg
    (convert_expr(e.e.call_variant->arg,f_type->func->arg_type));
  expression_ptr call (new call_expression(fun,arg));
  return conform_types(f_type->func->result_type,type,call,e);
}

@ The main work here has been relegated to |resolve_overload|; otherwise we
just need to take care of the things mentioned in the module name. In fact
there is one more case where overload resolution is not invoked than that name
mentions, namely when the argument expression is an empty tuple display, since
overloading with void argument type is forbidden. But this special treatment
of empty arguments makes a global value with type function-without-arguments
almost behave like an overloaded instance; the user should just avoid
providing a nonempty argument of void type, which is bad practice anyway.

The cases relegated to |resolve_overload| include calls of special operators
like the size-of operator~`\#', even in case such an operator should not occur
in the overload table.

@< Convert and |return| an overloaded function call... @>=
{ const Hash_table::id_type id =e.e.call_variant->fun.e.identifier_variant;
  const expr arg=e.e.call_variant->arg;
  size_t i,j; // dummies; local binding not used here
  if (not is_empty(arg) and id_context->lookup(id,i,j)==NULL)
  { const overload_table::variant_list& variants
      = global_overload_table->variants(id);
    if (variants.size()>0 or is_special_operator(id))
      return resolve_overload(e,type,variants);
  }
}

@ The names of some special operators are tested for each time we analyse an
overloaded call. The numeric values of these identifiers are not known
explicitly at compile time, but they will not change once the tables are
initialised; to avoid having to look them up in |main_hash_table| each time,
we store each one in a static variable inside a dedicated local function.

@< Local function definitions @>=
Hash_table::id_type equals_name()
{@; static Hash_table::id_type name=main_hash_table->match_literal("=");
  return name;
}

Hash_table::id_type size_of_name()
{@; static Hash_table::id_type name=main_hash_table->match_literal("#");
  return name;
}
Hash_table::id_type print_name()
{@; static Hash_table::id_type name=main_hash_table->match_literal("print");
  return name;
}
Hash_table::id_type prints_name()
{@; static Hash_table::id_type name=main_hash_table->match_literal("prints");
  return name;
}
@)
inline bool is_special_operator(Hash_table::id_type id)
{@; return id==size_of_name()
        or id==print_name()
        or id==prints_name(); }

@ For overloaded function calls, once the overloading is resolved, we proceed
in a similar fashion to non-overloaded calls, except that there is no function
expression to convert (the overload table contains an already evaluated
function value, either built-in or user-defined). We deal with the built-in
case here, and will give the user-defined case later when we have discussed
the necessary value types.

As a special safety measure against the easily made error of writing `\.='
instead of an assignment operator~`\.{:=}', we forbid converting to void the
result of an (always overloaded) call to the equality operator, treating this
case as a type error instead. In the unlikely case that the user defines an
overloaded instance of `\.=' with void result type, calls to this operator
will still be accepted.

@< Return a call of variant |v|... @>=
{ expression_ptr call;
  builtin_value* f = dynamic_cast<builtin_value*>(v.val.get());
  if (f!=NULL)
    call = expression_ptr
      (new overloaded_builtin_call(f->val,f->print_name.c_str(),arg));
  else @< Set |call| to the call of the user-defined function |v| @>

  if (type==void_type and
      id==equals_name() and
      v.type->result_type!=void_type)
    throw type_error(e,copy(v.type->result_type),copy(type));
  return conform_types(v.type->result_type,type,call,e);
}

@ For operator symbols that satisfy |is_special_operator(id)|, we test generic
argument type patterns before we test instances in the overload table, because
the latter could otherwise mask some generic ones due to coercion. Therefore
if we fail to find a match, we simply fall through; however if we match an
argument type but fail to match the returned type, we throw a |type_error|.

The function |print| (but not |prints|) will return the value printed if
required, so it has the type of a generic identity function. This is done so
that inserting |print| around subexpressions for debugging purposes can be
done without other modifications of the user program. Any call to |print| is
accepted without check of the argument, and to ensure that coercions that
would apply in the absence of |print| still get their chance, we call
|conform_types| to possibly insert them at the outside of that call (so the
value printed is the one before any coercion). It is still theoretically
possible that inserting a call to print into valid code results in an error,
namely for argument expressions that \emph{need} the type expected by the
context in order to pass the type check. These cases are quite rare though,
and can be overcome by inserting a cast inside the |print|. Moreover, in such
cases an error will have been reported before we even get to this code, due to
the fact that we have required that arguments can be analysed to
|a_priori_type| without benefit of a context type; therefore there is nothing
we could do about it here.

In the case of |prints|, the context must either expect or accept a void
result, which is the condition that the call |type.specialise(void_type)|
below tests.

@< If |id| is a special operator like size-of... @>=
{ if (id==size_of_name())
  { if (a_priori_type.kind==row_type)
    { expression_ptr call(new overloaded_builtin_call(sizeof_wrapper,"#",arg));
      return conform_types(int_type,type,call,e);
    }
    else if (a_priori_type.kind!=undetermined_type and
             a_priori_type.specialise(pair_type))
    @< Recognise and return 2-argument versions of `\#', or fall through in
       case of failure @>
  }
  else if (id==print_name()) // this one always matches
  { expression c = new generic_builtin_call(print_wrapper,"print",arg);
    expression_ptr call(c); // get ownership
    return conform_types(a_priori_type,type,call,e);
 }
  else if(id==prints_name()) // this always matches as well
  { expression c = new generic_builtin_call(prints_wrapper,"prints",arg);
    expression_ptr call(c); // get ownership
    if (type.specialise(void_type))
      return call.release();
    throw type_error(e,copy(void_type),copy(type));

expression, we must dynamically evaluate this function part, and then test
whether it is a built-in or a user-defined function. In the former case we
evaluate the arguments, expanding them on the |execution_stack|, and then call
the built-in function. In that call we pass the |level| parameter that was
passed to the |evaluate| method we are executing, so that if necessary the
built-in function can in its turn return and expanded result (or no result at
all). The evaluation of user-defined functions will be detailed later, but we
can already say that in this case it will be more useful to receive the
argument on the stack as a single value. As a general mechanism to aid
locating errors, we signal if an error was produced during the evaluation of a
function call, but we make sure the evaluation of the arguments(s) is done
outside this |try| block, since reporting functions that have not yet started
executing would be confusing.

@< Function definitions @>=
void call_expression::evaluate(level l) const
{ function->eval(); @+ shared_value fun=pop_value();
@/builtin_value* f=dynamic_cast<builtin_value*>(fun.get());
  argument->evaluate(f==NULL ? single_value : multi_value);
  try
  { if (f==NULL)
      @< Call user-defined function |fun| with argument on |execution_stack| @>
    else // built-in functions
      (*f->val)(l); // call the wrapper function, handling |l| appropriately
  }
  @< Catch-block for exceptions thrown within function calls @>
}

@ Although we catch all |std::exception| errors thrown during the execution of
a function call, we only report it if the function was referred to by an
identifier, for otherwise the message would become too messy. Even though the
test whether the |function| field of our |call_expression| is an identifier is
done using a |dynamic_cast| during evaluation, this is a syntactic and
therefore unchanging property of the call expression (we could have added a
Boolean field to record it for instance). It may be noted that having an
identifier as |function| in a |call_expression| is a rare circumstance, since
most function calls will lead to an |overloaded_builtin_call| or an
|overloaded_closure_call|, which will be treated later. Currently however
recursive function calls necessarily involve a general |call_expression|.

In the mentioned case we tack a line with the function name to the error
string, and re-throw the error. This will result in a traceback, inner to
outer, of interrupted (non anonymous) function calls. Different types of error
could be concerned: |std::runtime_error| thrown in some |evaluate| method or
built-in function is the most common case, but there could be some
|std::logic_error| as well, and |std::bad_alloc| is also always a possibility.
Since the base class |std::exception| provides no means to influence on
throwing the message produced by the |what| method, nor does |std::bad_alloc|,
we necessarily have to relabel the latter as |std::runtime_error| in order to
extend the error message. However we can maintain the distinction between a
|logic_error| and a |runtime_error| using a dynamic cast.

@< Catch-block for exceptions thrown within function calls @>=
catch (const std::exception& e)
{ identifier* p=dynamic_cast<identifier*>(function);
  if (p!=NULL) // named function
  {
    const std::logic_error* l_err= dynamic_cast<const std::logic_error*>(&e);
    if (l_err!=NULL)
      throw std::logic_error
        (std::string(e.what())+"\n(in call of "+p->name()+')');
    throw std::runtime_error
      (std::string(e.what())+"\n(in call of "+p->name()+')');
  }
  throw; // for anonymous function calls, just rethrow the error unchanged
}

@*1 Evaluating overloaded built-in function calls.
%
Calling an overloaded built-in function calls the wrapper function after
evaluating the argument(s). We provide the same trace of interrupted functions
by temporarily catching errors as in the case of non-overloaded function
calls, but here we need not test that the call was one of a named function.

@< Function definitions @>=
void overloaded_builtin_call::evaluate(level l) const
{ argument->multi_eval();
  try
  {@; (*f)(l); }
  catch (const std::exception& e)
  { const std::logic_error* l_err= dynamic_cast<const std::logic_error*>(&e);
    if (l_err!=NULL)
      throw std::logic_error
        (std::string(e.what())+"\n(in call of "+print_name+')');
    throw std::runtime_error
      (std::string(e.what())+"\n(in call of "+print_name+')');
  }
}

@ For generic built-in functions like |print| we only change the fact that
arguments are evaluated using |eval| to a single value on the stack.

@< Function definitions @>=
void generic_builtin_call::evaluate(level l) const
{ argument->eval();
  try
  {@; (*f)(l); }
  catch (const std::exception& e)
  { const std::logic_error* l_err= dynamic_cast<const std::logic_error*>(&e);
    if (l_err!=NULL)
      throw std::logic_error
        (std::string(e.what())+"\n(in call of "+print_name+')');
    throw std::runtime_error
      (std::string(e.what())+"\n(in call of "+print_name+')');
  }
}

@*1 Some special wrapper functions.
%
In this chapter we define some wrapper functions that are not accessed through
the overload table; they must be directly visible to the type checking code
that inserts them, which is why they are defined as local functions to the
current \.{evaluator.w} module.

The function |print| outputs any value in the format used by the interpreter
itself. This function has an argument of unknown type; we just pass the popped
value to the |operator<<|. The function returns its argument unchanged as
result, which facilitates inserting |print| statements for debugging purposes.

This is the first place in this file where we produce user output to a file.
In general, rather than writing directly to |std::cout|, we shall pass via a
pointer whose |output_stream| value is maintained in the main program, so that
redirecting output to a different stream can be easily implemented. Since this
is a wrapper function there is no other way to convey the output stream to be
used than via a dedicated global variable.

@< Local function definitions @>=
void print_wrapper(expression_base::level l)
{
  *output_stream << *execution_stack.back() << std::endl;
  if (l!=expression_base::single_value)
    push_expanded(l,pop_value()); // remove and possibly expand value
}

@ Sometimes the user may want to use a stripped version of the |print| output:
no quotes in case of a string value, or no parentheses or commas in case of a
tuple value (so that a single statement can chain several texts on the same
line). The |prints_wrapper| does this down to the level of omitting quotes in
individual argument strings, using dynamic casts to determine the case that
applies.

@< Local function definitions @>=
void prints_wrapper(expression_base::level l)
{ shared_value v=pop_value();
  string_value* s=dynamic_cast<string_value*>(v.get());
  if (s!=NULL)
    *output_stream << s->val << std::endl;
  else
  { tuple_value* t=dynamic_cast<tuple_value*>(v.get());
    if (t!=NULL)
    { for (size_t i=0; i<t->val.size(); ++i)
      { s=dynamic_cast<string_value*>(t->val[i].get());
        if (s!=NULL)
	  *output_stream << s->val;
        else
           *output_stream << *t->val[i];
      }
      *output_stream << std::endl;
    }
    else
      *output_stream << *v << std::endl; // just like |print| in other cases
  }
  if (l==expression_base::single_value)
    wrap_tuple(0); // don't forget to return a value if asked for
}

@ The generic size-of wrapper is used to find the length of any ``row-of''
value. Finding sizes of other objects like vectors, matrices, polynomials,
will require more specialised unary overloads of the `\#' operator.

@< Local function definitions @>=
void sizeof_wrapper(expression_base::level l)
{ size_t s=get<row_value>()->val.size();
  if (l!=expression_base::no_value)
    push_value(new int_value(s));
}

@ The operator `\#' can be used also as infix operator, to join (concatenate)
two row values of the same type or to extend one on either end by a single
element. In the former case we require that both arguments have identical row
type, in the latter case we allow the single element to be, or to be converted
to, the component type of the row value.

There is a subtlety in the order here, due to the fact that one of the
arguments could be the empty list, with undetermined row type. Then there is
actual ambiguity: with `\#' interpreted as join, the result is just the other
operand, while suffixing or prefixing to the empty list gives a singleton of
the other operand, and to some operands the empty list itself can also be
suffixed or prefixed. The simplest resolution of this ambiguity is to say that
join never applies with one of the arguments of undetermined list type, and
that suffixing is preferred over prefixing (for instance $[[2]]\#[\,]$ will
give $[[2],[\,]]$, but $[\,]\#[[2]]$ will give $[[[2]]]$). This can be
obtained by testing for suffixing before testing for join: after the former
test we know the first argument does not have type \.{[*]}, so it will match
the second argument type only if both are determined row types.

In order to be as general as a user might expect, we allow the additional
component to be suffixed or prefixed to a row value to be coerced to the
component type of that row. There are some technical complications that
justify defining a small function |can_coerce_arg| to handle this, which are
explained at the definition of this function below. The arguments to this
function are: a tuple (pair) expression, an index of a component ($0$ or $1$),
the initial type of that component of the pair and the (component) type it
should be coerced to. The function returns a success code, and may have
modified the component type (by specialising it) or the pair expression (by
inserting a coercion) if (and only if) it returns |true|.

@< Recognise and return 2-argument versions of `\#'... @>=
{ type_expr& arg_tp0 = a_priori_type.tuple->t;
  type_expr& arg_tp1 = a_priori_type.tuple->next->t;
  if (arg_tp0.kind==row_type)
  { if (can_coerce_arg(arg.get(),1,arg_tp1,*arg_tp0.component_type)) // suffix
    { expression_ptr call(new overloaded_builtin_call
        (suffix_element_wrapper,"#",arg));
      return conform_types(arg_tp0,type,call,e);
    }
    if (arg_tp0==arg_tp1) // join
    { expression_ptr call(new overloaded_builtin_call
        (join_rows_wrapper,"#",arg));
      return conform_types(arg_tp0,type,call,e);
    }
  }
  if (arg_tp1.kind==row_type and @|
         can_coerce_arg(arg.get(),0,arg_tp0,*arg_tp1.component_type))
          // prefix
  { expression_ptr call(new overloaded_builtin_call
      (prefix_element_wrapper,"#",arg));
    return conform_types(arg_tp1,type,call,e);
  }
}

@ We called |can_coerce_arg| when type-checking the dyadic use of the operator
`\#', in order to see if one of its arguments can be coerced from its type
|from| to |to|. The situation there is somewhat unusual, in that we have
already converted the entire argument expression at the point where we
discover, based on the type found, that one of the arguments might need to be
coerced. This means that such a coercion must be inserted into an already
constructed expression, whereas usually it is applied on the outside of an
expression under construction (notably in ordinary overloading if coercion is
needed we simply convert the operands a second time, inserting the coercions
while doing so). Concretely this means that although we can use the |coerce|
function, it wants a reference to an auto-pointer for the expression needing
modification (so that it can manage ownership during its operation), but the
expression here is held in an ordinary pointer inside a |tuple_expression|.
Therefore we must copy the ordinary |expression| pointer temporarily to an
|expression_ptr| auto-pointer that |coerce| will manage; once constructed we
set the |expression| component (temporarily) to~|NULL| to avoid potential
double destruction, and after the call to |coerce| we release the (possibly
modified) |expression_ptr| back into the |expression|.

Before we plunge into this coercion insertion, we test if the types can be
made to match without coercion, after possibly specialising the type |to|
(which might be undefined, for instance when suffixing/prefixing to an empty
list).

Another complication is that we decided having a dyadic use of `\#' based on
finding a 2-tuple type, but this is no guarantee there are actually two
operand subexpressions (in a |tuple_expression|); we do a dynamic cast to find
that out, and in the case the user was so contrived as to use monadic `\#' on
a non-tuple expression of 2-tuple type, we just report that no coercion of
operands is done (after all we need a subexpression to be able to insert any
conversion). These complications warrant defining a separate function to
handle them.

@< Local function definitions @>=
bool can_coerce_arg
  (expression e,size_t i,const type_expr& from,type_expr& to)
{ if (to.specialise(from))
    return true; // type matches without coercion
  tuple_expression* tup= dynamic_cast<tuple_expression*>(e);
  if (tup==NULL)
    return false; // we need a pair to insert a coercion
  expression_ptr comp(tup->component[i]); tup->component[i]=NULL;
  bool result = coerce(from,to,comp); tup->component[i]=comp.release();
  return result;
}


@* Let-expressions.
%
We shall now consider a simple type of expression in which local variables
occur, the let-expression. It is equivalent to an anonymous function
($\lambda$-expression) applied to the expression(s) in the let-declarations,
but no types need to be declared for the function parameters, since the types
of the corresponding expressions can be used for this. Nevertheless, we
currently convert let-expressions to an internal form that is exactly an
application of a $\lambda$-expression, hiding the syntactic origin of the
expression. This economy of implementation does not seem to have a too
negative effect on performance. (However it might still be that a direct
implementation of let-expressions, without building an intermediate closure
value, turns out to be more efficient, so this implementation of
let-expressions could change in the future.) In our presentation this gives
us an occasion to introduce $\lambda$-expressions as a new form
of~|expression|, but in fact it is quite useful independently of its use for
let-expressions.

@ We prepare the definition of $\lambda$-expression with the introduction of
auxiliary types, needed to deal with the general patterns by which formal
function parameters can be given. The parser produces values accessed by
pointers to |struct id_pat@;| to describe such patterns. The structure can be
used directly in a $\lambda$-expression, but we must handle some questions of
ownership. The value produced by the parser will be destroyed after the
command is processed, at which time the $\lambda$-expression could still
exist, so we cannot simply use a non-owned pointer. Moreover a
$\lambda$-expression can be evaluated one or more times, yielding ``closure''
values the might outlive the $\lambda$-expression, so appropriate duplication
or sharing must be organised. We opt for sharing, which will be done by a
|shared_ptr| supplied with a specialised deleter, since the sharing is done at
the outermost level only, but complete destruction requires calling
|destroy_id_pat| (defined in the file \.{parsetree.w}). To get this deleter
without runtime storage, we wrap it into a zero-size structure.

@< Type def... @>=
struct id_pat_deleter
{@; void operator()(id_pat* p) @+{@; destroy_id_pat(p); delete p; }};
typedef std::tr1::shared_ptr<id_pat> shared_pattern;
  // deleter type does not enter into this

@ We must also treat the question of obtaining ownership of an |id_pat|
structure. An top level node to be shared must certainly be allocated (the
parser never executes an |new idpat| creating such an isolated node), but we
might steal a possible |sublist| field, replacing it in the original by a null
pointer to avoid double destruction. However doing a deep copy is a cleaner
solution, which avoids modifying the parsed expression and isolates us from
the allocation policy used in the parser, which might change.

To provide exception safety during the copy, it seems for once easier to
explicitly catch and clean up than to introduce an intermediate class only for
exception safety. The cleaning up by |destroy_id_pat(&result);| recursively
deletes all the nodes created by the calls to |new pattern_node| within the
current loop, as well as everything accessible from the |body| fields that
were filled by a \emph{successful} recursive call to |copy_id_pat| (in case
one such call was in fact responsible for the exception, the corresponding
body will not have been assigned, and the |pattern_node| is in its original
constructed state, which has no loose ends and is therefore safe for
|destroy_id_pat|). In particular at each point where an exception might be
thrown the argument to |destroy_id_pat| is properly |NULL|-terminated (by the
|pattern_node| constructor).

@< Local function def... @>=
id_pat copy_id_pat(const id_pat& p)
{
  id_pat result=p; // shallow copy
  try
  { if ((p.kind&0x2)!=0)
    { result.sublist=NULL;
      for (patlist s=p.sublist,*d=&result.sublist;
           s!=NULL; s=s->next,d=&(*d)->next)
      @/{@;
        *d=new pattern_node; (*d)->body=copy_id_pat(s->body);
      }
    }
  }
  catch (...) @+{@; destroy_id_pat(&result); throw; }
  return result;
}

@ Now we can define our $\lambda$-expression to use a |shared_pattern|; the
body is also shared.

@< Type def... @>=
struct lambda_expression : public expression_base
{ const shared_pattern param;
  shared_expression body;

  virtual ~lambda_expression() @+{} // subobjects do all the work
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const;
};

@ The main constructor cannot be inside the class definition, as it requires
the local function |copy_id_pat|. It creates a new node at the head of
|param|, which will henceforth be shared, and fills it with a deep copy. For
the body we create sharing as well, which is simpler since the passed
auto-pointer already gives us ownership.

@< Function def... @>=
inline
lambda_expression::lambda_expression(const id_pat& p, expression_ptr b)
: param(new id_pat(copy_id_pat(p)),id_pat_deleter()) , body(b.release())
@+{}

@ To print an anonymous function, we print the parameter, enclosed in
parentheses if the full parameter is named, followed by a colon and by the
function body. The printed parameter list cannot include types with the
current setup, as they are not explicitly stored after type analysis. It could
be made possible to print types if a type were explicitly stored in the
|lambda_expression| structure; at the time of writing this would seem
possible because each function has to have a definite type, but if the type
system were extended with second order types (which would be quite useful),
then this might no longer be true.

@< Function definitions @>=

    for (patlist p=pat.sublist; p!=NULL; p=p->next,l=l->next)
      thread_bindings(p->body,l->t,dst);

@ Finally, at runtime we shall perform a similar manipulation with an

    for (patlist p=pat.sublist; p!=NULL; p=p->next,++i)
      thread_components(p->body,t->val[i],dst);
  }
}

@ To convert a let-expression, we first deduce the type of the declared
identifiers from the right hand side of its declaration, then set up new
bindings for those identifiers with the type found, and finally convert the
body to the required type in the extended context. Note that the constructed
|bindings| remains a local variable, but it is temporarily preprended to the
context by calling |push| and |pop| with the pointer variable |id_context|.
The |expression| obtained from converting the body is first turned into a
|lambda_expression|, and then an application of that expression to the
argument is produced and returned.

@< Cases for type-checking and converting... @>=
case let_expr:
{ let lexp=e.e.let_variant;
  id_pat& pat=lexp->pattern;
  type_ptr decl_type=pattern_type(pat);

  expression_ptr func(new lambda_expression(pat,body));
  return new call_expression(func,arg);
}

@ Before we can dicuss the evaluation of user-defined functions, we need to
introduce a type for the intermediate value produced by the anonymous
function, before it is actually called. Such a value is traditionally called a
closure, and it contains (a reference to) the expression body, as well as the
evaluation context current at the point the anonymous function is produced.

@< Type def... @>=
struct closure_value : public value_base
{ context_ptr cont;
  shared_pattern param;

  static const char* name() @+{@; return "closure"; }
};
typedef std::auto_ptr<closure_value> closure_ptr;
typedef std::tr1::shared_ptr<closure_value> shared_closure;

@ For now a closure prints just like the |lambda_expression| from which it was
obtained. One could imagine printing after this body ``where'' followed by the
bindings held in the |context| field. Even better only the bindings for
relevant (because referenced) identifiers could be printed.

@< Function def... @>=

@ A call of a user-defined function passes through the same code as that of a
built-in function; after all, the type check does not make a difference
between the two kinds, so the distinction can only be made by a dynamic test
during evaluation (which test was already presented). After the test we come
to the code below, which in essence a call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus
evaluator. An important part of the implementation work is already done in the
form of the |context| data structure and the way applied local identifiers
have been translated into references by relative frame number and offset.
Notably the actual names of the identifiers are not used at all at runtime
(they are present in the |id_pat| structure for printing purposes, but ignored
by |thread_bindings| which is used here), and our implementation is one using
so-called ``nameless dummies''.

When we come here |f| must be a |closure_value|, and the argument has already
been evaluated, and is available as a single value on the |execution_stack|.
The evaluation of the call just temporarily replaces the current execution
context by one composed of the context stored in the closure onto which a new
frame defined by the parameter list |f->param| and the argument value is
pushed; the function body is evaluated in this extended context. Afterwards
the original context is restored from the local variable |saved_context|.

  if (dynamic_cast<tuple_expression*>(argument)!=NULL) out << *argument;
  else out << '(' << *argument << ')';
}

@ The identification of this case is done inside |resolve_overload|, after
testing that the value bound is not a built-in function. Since an |overload|

@ Evaluation of an overloaded function call bound to a closure is a simplified
version the part of |call_expression::evaluate| dedicated to a closures,
including the temporary catching of errors in order to produce a trace of
interrupted function calls in the error message, and the evaluation part of
section~@# lambda evaluation @>. The simplification consists
of the fact that the closure is already evaluated and stored, and that in
particular we don't have to distinguish dynamically between built-in functions
and closures, nor between calls of anonymous or named functions (we are always
in the latter case) for producing the error trace.

  }
}

@* User-defined functions.
%
Now we shall consider the general case of a user-defined function. But nearly
all of the work is already done, notably defining the evaluation of built-in
and user-defined functions, whether occurring in an overloaded call or in
another form of function call. In fact all that remains to be done is defining
how to type-check and convert the case |lambda_expr| of an |expr| constructed
by the parser; the necessary types derived from |expression| that provide
their implementation were already introduced.

We first test if the required |type| specialises to a function type, i.e.,
either it was some function type or undefined. Then we get the argument type
|arg_type| from the function expression the parser provided. We further
specialise the argument type of |type| to the argument type of the function
(signalling a type error in the rare cases that a different type was
expected). Then a call to |thread_bindings| extracts from the specified
pattern |id_pat| the identifiers it contains, and couples them to the
associated types extracted from |arg_type|, storing the result in
|new_bindings|. These bindings are activated during the type-check and
conversion of the function body, after which the old |id_context| is restored
by popping of the bindings for the arguments.

@< Cases for type-checking and converting... @>=
case lambda_expr:
{ if (not type.specialise(gen_func_type))
    throw type_error(e,copy(gen_func_type),copy(type));
  lambda fun=e.e.lambda_variant;
  id_pat& pat=fun->pattern;
  type_expr& arg_type=*fun->arg_type;
  if (not type.func->arg_type.specialise(arg_type))
  @/throw type_error(e,
                     make_function_type(copy(arg_type),copy(unknown_type)),
                     copy(type));
  size_t n_id=count_identifiers(pat);
@/bindings new_bindings(n_id);
  thread_bindings(pat,arg_type,new_bindings);
  new_bindings.push(id_context);
  expression_ptr body(convert_expr(fun->body,type.func->result_type));
  new_bindings.pop(id_context);
  return new lambda_expression(pat,body);
}

@* Control structures.
%
We shall now introduce conventional control structures, which must of course
be part of any serious programming language; yet they were implemented only
after plenty of other language elements were in place, such as
let-expressions, functions, rows and selection form them, implicit
conversions.

In fact, the power of functions is such that certain control structures can be
simulated with functions. For instance, there are currently no multi-way
choice expressions (also known as |case| or |switch| statements), but one can
define an row of anonymous functions without parameters, use row selection to
pick out one of them based on an integer value, and then call it. Recursion is
not directly supported either, because anonymous $\lambda$-expressions have no
way of referring to themselves; however recursion can be realised assigning to
a local function variable as new value a $\lambda$-expression referring to
that same variable.

Nonetheless a good repertoire of control structures is essential to easy
programming. We provide the conditional expression as unique selection
statement, and a large variety of iterative statements. Somewhat unusual is
the fact that all control structures are expressions that may yield a value;
in the case of loop statements, a value of ``row-of'' type is returned.

@*1 Conditional expressions.
%
A first control structure it the conditional expression.

@< Type def... @>=
struct conditional_expression : public expression_base
{ expression condition, then_branch, else_branch;
@)
  conditional_expression(expression_ptr c,expression_ptr t, expression_ptr e)
   : condition(c.release()),then_branch(t.release()), else_branch(e.release())
  @+{}
  virtual ~conditional_expression()
  {@; delete condition; delete then_branch; delete else_branch; }
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const;
};

@ To print a conditional expression, we reconstruct \&{elif} constructions
that were eliminated in the parser (and even those that the user did not
employ, but could have). To this end, we remain in a loop as long as the
|else|-part is itself a conditional expression. This makes a loop with exit in
the middle a natural solution, and in any case \Cpp\ does not allow using a
variable introduced in the body, like |p| below, to be used it the condition
of a |while| or |for| controlling the loop.

@< Function definitions @>=
void conditional_expression::print(std::ostream& out) const
{ out << " if "; const conditional_expression* cur=this;
  do
  { out << *cur->condition << " then " << *cur->then_branch;
    conditional_expression* p =
      dynamic_cast<conditional_expression*>(cur->else_branch);
    if (p==NULL)
      break;
    out << " elif "; cur=p;
  }
  while(true);
  out << " else " << *cur->else_branch << " fi ";
}

@ For type-checking conditional expressions we are in a somewhat similar
situation as for list displays: both branches need to be of the same type, but
we might not know which. After checking that the |condition| yields a Boolean
value, we first convert the else-branch and then the then-branch. This unusual
order is explained by the possibility of an absent else-branch, which the
parser will replace by an empty tuple. If this happens in a context that does
not impose a result type, testing the else-branch first will set |type| to
|void_type|, after which the voiding coercion is available when type-checking
the then-branch; the opposite order might result in an error in converting the
void else-branch to the type of the then-branch.

This is the first place where we use that |bool_type| in not |const|; if it
had been, possible alternative solutions would be to take a copy of it, or
else to start with an undefined type and test afterwards that it has become
equal to |bool_type|. The latter option would be slightly different by
excluding any coercions to \&{bool} in the condition. However this would not
be noticeable since (currently) no such coercions exist anyway.

@< Cases for type-checking and converting... @>=
case conditional_expr:
{ expression_ptr c (convert_expr(e.e.if_variant->condition,bool_type));
  expression_ptr el (convert_expr(e.e.if_variant->else_branch,type));
  expression_ptr th (convert_expr(e.e.if_variant->then_branch,type));
  return new conditional_expression(c,th,el);
}

@ Evaluating a conditional expression ends up evaluating either the
then-branch or the else-branch.

@< Function definitions @>=
void conditional_expression::evaluate(level l) const
{ condition->eval();
  if (get<bool_value>()->val)
    then_branch->evaluate(l);
  @+ else else_branch->evaluate(l);
}

@*1 While loops.
%
Next we consider |while| loops, which have three parts (the final one is
optional; if absent it will be a null pointer).

@< Type def... @>=
struct while_expression : public expression_base
{ expression condition, body;
@)
  while_expression(expression_ptr c,expression_ptr b)
   : condition(c.release()),body(b.release())
  @+{}
  virtual ~while_expression() @+ {@; delete condition; delete body; }
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const;
};

@ Printing a |while| expression is straightforward.

@< Function definitions @>=
void while_expression::print(std::ostream& out) const
{@; out << " while " <<  *condition << " do " << *body << " od ";
}

@ Type checking is a bit more complicated for |while| loops that for
conditional expressions, because a row result must be produced. If the context
requires void type, we shall require the same for the body, knowing that
generation of a row value will be unconditionally suppressed in these cases
anyway. In all other cases we proceed for the body expression as for the
components of a row display (except that there is only one expression in this
case).

@< Cases for type-checking and converting... @>=
case while_expr:
{ w_loop w=e.e.while_variant;
  expression_ptr c (convert_expr(w->condition,bool_type));
  if (type==void_type or type.specialise(row_of_type))
  { expression_ptr b
     (convert_expr(w->body, @|
                   type==void_type ? void_type :*type.component_type));
    expression_ptr result(new while_expression(c,b));
    return type==void_type ? new voiding(result) : result.release();
  }
  else
  @< If |type| can be converted from some row-of type, check |w->body|
     against its component type, construct the |while_expression|, and apply
     the appropriate conversion function to it; otherwise |throw| a
     |type_error| @>
}

@ For |while| loops we follow the same logic for finding an appropriate
component type as for list displays.

@< If |type| can be converted from some row-of type, check |w->body| against
   its component type, construct the |while_expression|, and apply the
   appropriate conversion function to it; otherwise |throw| a |type_error| @>=
{ type_expr comp_type;
  const conversion_record* conv = row_coercion(type,comp_type);
  if (conv==NULL)
    throw type_error(e,copy(row_of_type),copy(type));
@)
  expression_ptr b(convert_expr(w->body,comp_type));
  return new conversion(*conv,  expression_ptr(new while_expression(c,b)));
}


@ Of course evaluating is what most distinguishes loops from conditionals.
There are few surprises: if no value is asked for we simple perform a |while|-loop at the \Cpp~level (applying |void_eval| to the body expression), and
otherwise we also do a |while|-loop, but use |eval| to produce a value on
|execution_stack| each time around, popping it off and pushing it onto a
|row_value| value that will ultimately become the value of the loop.

@< Function definitions @>=
void while_expression::evaluate(level l) const
{ if (l==no_value)
    while (condition->eval(),get<bool_value>()->val)
       body->void_eval();
  else
  { row_ptr result (new row_value(0));
    while (condition->eval(),get<bool_value>()->val)
    @/{@; body->eval();
      result->val.push_back(pop_value());
    }
    push_value(result);
  }
}

@*1 For loops.
%
Next we consider |for| loops over components of a value. They also have three
parts, an identifier pattern defining the loop variable(s), an in-part giving
the object whose components are iterated over, and a body that may produce a
new value for each component of the in-part. We allow iteration over vectors
and matrices, non-row types which are indexable by integers (for now this
means strings), and iteration over the terms of a parameter polynomial
(representing isotypical components of a virtual module). The syntactic
structure of the for loop is the same for all these cases.

@< Type def... @>=
struct for_expression : public expression_base
{ id_pat pattern; expression in_part, body; subscr_base::sub_type kind;
@)
  for_expression
   (id_pat p, expression_ptr i, expression_ptr b, subscr_base::sub_type k);
  virtual ~for_expression() @+
  {@; destroy_id_pat(&pattern); delete in_part; delete body; }
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const;
};

@ We could not inline the following constructor definition in the class
declaration, as it uses the local function |copy_id_pat| that is not known in
the header file.

@< Function definitions @>=
inline
for_expression::for_expression@|
 (id_pat p, expression_ptr i, expression_ptr b,subscr_base::sub_type k)
   : pattern(copy_id_pat(p)), in_part(i.release()), body(b.release()), kind(k)
  @+{}


@ Printing a |for| expression is straightforward, taking care that
|next_part| could be null.

@< Function definitions @>=
void for_expression::print(std::ostream& out) const
{ out << " for " << pattern.sublist->next->body;
    if (pattern.sublist->body.kind==0x1)
      out << '@@' << pattern.sublist->body;
    out << " in " << *in_part << " do " << *body << " od ";
}

@ Type checking is more complicated for |for| loops than for |while| loops,
since more types and potential coercions are involved. we start by processing
the in-part in a neutral type context, which will on success set |in_type| to
its a priori type.

@< Cases for type-checking and converting... @>=
case for_expr:
{ f_loop f=e.e.for_variant;
  bindings bind(count_identifiers(f->id));
   // for identifier(s) introduced in this loop
  type_expr in_type;
  expression_ptr in_expr(convert_expr(f->in_part,in_type));  // \&{in} part
  subscr_base::sub_type which; // the kind of aggregate iterated over
  @< Set |which| according to |in_type|, and set |bind| according to the
     identifiers contained in |f->id| @>
  type_expr body_type, *btp; const conversion_record* conv=NULL;
  if (type==void_type)
    btp=&void_type; // void context is more permissive for body
  else if (type.specialise(row_of_type))
    btp=type.component_type;
  else if ((conv=row_coercion(type,body_type))!=NULL)
    btp=&body_type;
  else throw type_error(e,copy(row_of_type),copy(type));
  bind.push(id_context);
  expression_ptr body(convert_expr (f->body,*btp));
@/bind.pop(id_context);
  expression_ptr loop(new for_expression(f->id,in_expr,body,which));
@/return type==void_type ? new voiding(loop) :
      @| conv!=NULL ? new conversion(*conv,loop) : @| loop.release() ;
}

@ This type must be indexable by integers (so it is either a row-type or
vector, matrix or string), or it must be loop over the coefficients of a
polynomial. The call to |subscr_base::indexable| will set |comp_type| to the
component type resulting from such a subscription.

@< Set |which| according to |in_type|, and set |bind| according to the
   identifiers contained in |f->id| @>=
{ type_expr comp_type; const type_expr* tp;
  if (subscr_base::indexable(in_type,*(tp=&int_type),comp_type,which) @|
   or subscr_base::indexable(in_type,*(tp=&param_type),comp_type,which))
  { type_ptr pt = pattern_type(f->id), @|
      it_type=make_tuple_type(make_type_list@|
      (copy(*tp),make_type_singleton(copy(comp_type))));
    if (not pt->specialise(*it_type))

    thread_bindings(f->id,*it_type,bind);
  }
  else
  { std::ostringstream o;
    o << "Cannot iterate over value of type " << in_type;
    throw expr_error(e,o.str());
  }
}

@ We can start evaluating the |in_part| regardless of |kind|, but for deducing
the number of iterations we must already distinguish on |kind| to predict the
type of the in-part. A |loop_frame| is constructed that will contain the
bindings for the new variables whose scope is the loop body: the loop variable
(with as value a component of the |in_part|), any named sub-components of it,
and the optional name given to the loop index. The shared pointers held in
this frame must be different on each iteration, because the body might get
hold, through a closure that incorporates the |context| constructed below, of
a copy of those pointers; this closure should not get to see changing values
of variables during subsequent iterations. On the other hand, the syntax does
not allow users to name the entire tuple |loop_var| formed of the loop index
and the in-part component, so this pointer cannot end up in the |loop_frame|
and it may remain the same between iterations.

@< Function definitions @>=
void for_expression::evaluate(level l) const

@ Since the module below exists only for the sake of source-code sharing, we
don't bother to put braces around its expansion, as they are not needed in the

We set the in-part component stored in |loop_var->val[1]| separately for the
various values of |kind|, but |loop_var->val[0]| is always the (integral) loop
index. Once initialised, |loop_var| is passed through the function
|thread_components| to set up |loop_frame|, whose pointers are copied into a
new |context| that extends the initial |saved_context| to form the new
|execution_context|. Like for |loop_var->val[0]|, it is important that
|execution_context| be set to point to a newly created node at each iteration,
since any closure values in the loop body will incorporate its current
instance; there would be no point in supplying fresh pointers in |loop_var| if
they were subsequently copied to overwrite the pointers in the same |context|
object each time. Once these things have been handled, the evaluation of the
loop body is standard.

we find a bare function value, we must abuse the |denotation| class a bit to
serve as wrapper that upon evaluation will return the value again.

@* Assignments.
%
Syntactically there is hardly anything simpler than simple assignment
statements. However, semantically we distinguish assignments to local and to
global variables; the two kinds will be converted into objects of classes
derived from |assignment_expr|.

@< Type definitions @>=

  virtual void print(std::ostream& out) const;
};

@ Printing proceeds as usual for identifiers and converted expressions.
@< Function def... @>=
void assignment_expr::print(std::ostream& out) const
{@; out << main_hash_table->name_of(lhs) << ":=" << *rhs; }

@ For global assignments we need to access the location where the identifier
is stored, as in the case of applied identifiers, but we need a non-|const|
access to it.

@< Type definitions @>=
class global_assignment : public assignment_expr
{ shared_share address;
public:
  global_assignment(Hash_table::id_type l,expression_ptr r);
  virtual ~global_assignment() @+{}
  virtual void evaluate(level l) const;
};

@ The constructor for |global_assignment| is rather similar to that for
|global_identifier|.

@< Function def... @>=
global_assignment::global_assignment(Hash_table::id_type l,expression_ptr r)
: assignment_expr(l,r), address(global_id_table->address_of(l)) @+{}

@ Evaluating a global assignment evaluates the left hand side, and replaces
the old value stored at |*address| by the new (shared pointer) value.

@< Function def... @>=
void global_assignment::evaluate(level l) const
{@; rhs->eval();
  *address = pop_value();
  push_expanded(l,*address);
}

@ For local assignments we also need to access the location where the
identifier is stored, but as in the case of applied identifiers this location
cannot be known when the statement is type-checked and converted (and in fact
it may vary between evaluations of the same assignment) so we need to store
coordinates of the identifier in the evaluation context.

@< Type definitions @>=
class local_assignment : public assignment_expr
{ size_t depth, offset;

{ rhs->eval();
  shared_value& dest =  execution_context->elem(depth,offset);
  dest= pop_value();
  push_expanded(l,dest);
}


@ Type-checking and converting assignment statements follows the same lines as
that of applied identifiers as far as discriminating between local and global
is concerned. We first look in |id_context| for a local binding of the
identifier, and if not found we look in |global_id_table|. If found in either
way,

@< Cases for type-checking and converting... @>=

@*1 Component assignments.
%
The language we are implementing does not employ the notion of sub-object; in
other words if one sets $b=a[i]$ for some list, vector or matrix $a$, then $s$
will behave as a copy of the entry $a[i]$ rather than as an alias, so
subsequent assignment to $b$ will not affect~$a$ or vice versa. (This does no
prevent us to share storage between $b$ and $a$ initially, it just means the
sharing should be broken if $b$ or $a$ are modified.) This simplifies the
semantic model considerably, but if we want to allow creating composite values
by subsequently setting their components, we need to allow assignments of the
form $a[i]:=c$. The meaning of this is the same as assigning a new value to
all of $a$ that differs from the original value only at index~$i$; it may
however be expected to be implemented more efficiently if the storage of $a$
is not currently shared, as would usually be the case at least from the second
such assignment to~$a$ on. The interpreter will have to treat such component
assignments as a whole (with three components $a,i,c$), which also means that
it will not be able to handle something like $a[i][j]:=c$ even when that would
seem to make sense (however $m[i,j]:=c$ for matrix values $m$ will be
supported).

In fact we need to implement a whole range of component assignments: there are
assignments to general row-value components, to vector and matrix components
and to matrix columns, and all this for local variables as well as for global
ones. Like for general assignments we can start with a base class that
implements common methods, and derive the specialised versions from it later.
In fact by deriving from |assignment_expr| we only need to add the index as
data member. We also provide a method |assign| that will do the real work for
the |evaluate| methods of the derived classes, after those have located
address of the aggregate to be modified and the type of component assignment
to apply.

@< Type definitions @>=
struct component_assignment : public assignment_expr

identifier is stored.

@< Type definitions @>=
class global_component_assignment : public component_assignment
{ subscr_base::sub_type kind;
  shared_share address;

   subscr_base::sub_type k)
: component_assignment(a,i,r)
, kind(k),address(global_id_table->address_of(a)) @+{}

@ It is in evaluation that component assignments differ most from ordinary
ones. The work is delegated to the |assign| method of the base class, which is
given a reference to the |shared_value| pointer holding the current value of
the aggregate; it is this pointer that is in principle modified. Like when
fetching the value of a global variable, we must be aware of a possible
undefined value in the variable.

@< Function def... @>=
void global_component_assignment::evaluate(level l) const
{ if (address->get()==NULL)
  { std::ostringstream o;

      << main_hash_table->name_of(lhs);
    throw std::runtime_error(o.str());
  }
  assign(l,*address,kind);
}

@ The |assign| method, which will also be called for local component
assignments, starts by the common work of evaluating the index and the value
to be assigned, and of making sure the aggregate variable is made to point to
a unique copy of its current value, which copy can then be modified in place.
For actually changing the aggregate, we must distinguish cases according to
the kind of component assignment at hand. Assignments to components of
rational vectors and of strings will be forbidden, see module
@#comp_ass_type_check@>.

@< Function def... @>=
void component_assignment::assign
  (level l,shared_value& aggregate, subscr_base::sub_type kind) const
{ rhs->eval();
  uniquify(aggregate);
  value loc=aggregate.get(); // simple reference from shared pointer
  switch (kind)
  { case subscr_base::row_entry:
  @/@< Replace component at |index| in row |loc| by value on stack @>

  @+break;
  default: {} // remaining cases are eliminated in type analysis
  }
}

@ A |row_value| component assignment is the simplest kind. The variable |loc|
holds a generic pointer, known to refer to a |row_value|. Since we need their
value, but not for incorporation into a result, we use |force| to get ordinary
pointers of the right kind. Then we do a bound check, and on success replace a
component of the value held in |a| by the stack-top value. Afterwards,
depending on |l|, we may put back the stack-top value as result of the
component assignment, possibly expanding a tuple in the process.

@< Replace component at |index| in row |loc|... @>=
{ unsigned int i=(index->eval(),get<int_value>()->val);
  row_value& a=*force<row_value>(loc);
  if (i>=a.val.size())
    throw std::runtime_error(range_mess(i,a.val.size(),this));
  a.val[i]= pop_value();
  push_expanded(l,a.val[i]);
}

@ For |vec_value| entry assignments the type of the aggregate object is
vector, and the value assigned always an integer. The latter certainly needs
no expansion, so we either leave it on the stack, or remove it if the value of
the component assignment expression is not used.

@< Replace entry at |index| in vector |loc|... @>=
{ unsigned int i=(index->eval(),get<int_value>()->val);
  vector_value& v=*force<vector_value>(loc);
  if (i>=v.val.size())

  v.val[i]= force<int_value>(execution_stack.back().get())->val;
  if (l==no_value)
    execution_stack.pop_back();
}

@ For |mat_value| entry assignments at |index| must be split into a pair of
indices, and there are two bound checks.

@< Replace entry at |index| in matrix |loc|... @>=
{ index->multi_eval();
  unsigned int j=get<int_value>()->val;
  unsigned int i=get<int_value>()->val;
@/
  matrix_value& m=*force<matrix_value>(loc);
  if (i>=m.val.numRows())
    throw std::runtime_error(range_mess(i,m.val.numRows(),this));
  if (j>=m.val.numColumns())
    throw std::runtime_error(range_mess(j,m.val.numColumns(),this));
  m.val(i,j)= force<int_value>(execution_stack.back().get())->val;
  if (l==no_value)
    execution_stack.pop_back();
}

@ A |matrix_value| column assignment is like that of a vector entry, but we
add a test for matching column length.

@< Replace columns at |index| in matrix |loc|... @>=
{ unsigned int j=(index->eval(),get<int_value>()->val);
  matrix_value& m=*force<matrix_value>(loc);
  const vector_value& v=*force<vector_value>(execution_stack.back().get());
  if (j>=m.val.numColumns())
    throw std::runtime_error(range_mess(j,m.val.numColumns(),this));
  if (v.val.size()!=m.val.numRows())
