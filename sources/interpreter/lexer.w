@* Introduction.
This file describes a lexical scanner that provides a layer situated between
the class |BufferedInput| that provides lines of input, and the parser that is
to receive a sequence of tokens. The functionality provided is the recognition
of tokens, in particular keywords and constants. The module \.{buffer} is used
that provides classes for tables that store identifiers and encode them by
small numbers, as well as the class |BufferedInput| itself.

@h "buffer.h"


@ As usual the external interface is written to the header file associated to
this file.

@( lexer.h @>=
#ifndef LEXER_H
#define LEXER_H
@p@;
namespace atlas { namespace interpreter {

@< Class declarations @>@;
@< Declarations of exported functions @>@;
@< Declarations of static variables @>@;

}@; }@;
#endif

@ Here we include only our own header file \.{lexer.h}; all other include
directives will go to that file, as indicated in the previous section (this
might be a bit wasteful, but only system header files are concerned).

@ Since there is one central hash table, and other parts of the program must
have access to it, for instance to look up names of identifiers, we define a
static variable with a pointer to this hash table.

@< Declarations of static variables @>=
extern Hash_table* main_hash_table;

@~We initialise this variable to the null pointer; the main program will make
it point to the main hash table once it is allocated.

@< Definitions of static variables @>=
Hash_table* main_hash_table=NULL;

@*1 Identifier completion.
%
We define a completion function |id_completion_func| that will be used by the
\.{readline} library. This is done here since it deals with the hash table,
but strictly speaking this has nothing to do with lexical analysis. The
completion function will be installed in the main program, and it will be
called from the |readline| function (which is probably called by
|BufferedInput::getline|) if the user asks for it. The function prototype is
dictated by the \.{readline} library.

@< Declarations of exported functions @>=
extern "C"
char* id_completion_func(const char* text, int state);

@~The completion function will find and identifiers currently present in the
main hash table. This includes keywords, built-in functions and identifiers
introduced by the user, the latter possibly even by error (which is possibly
annoying for those who make many typos). It has some strange characteristics
that are dictated by the \.{readline} library. It must perform a loop that is
actually started \emph{outside} the function body, so the only possible way to
keep track of the loop state is using static variables. The |state| parameter
signals (by being~|0|) when a new loop starts, so in that case it is time to
(re-)initialise the static variables. A part of the loop can be picked up
inside the function body, namely the search for the next match to the supplied
prefix |text|. A tricky point is that once a partial match is found, we must
increment the static iterator before returning, since that |return| jumps out
of our local loop. For this reason we increment |i| right away while picking
its identifier from the hash table. Otherwise there are no other complications,
except having to produce a string allocated by |malloc|. If our local
loop terminates normally there are no more matches and we return |NULL| to
indicate that.

@h <cstdlib>
@< Function definitions @>=
extern "C"
char* id_completion_func(const char* text, int state)
{ static size_t l; static Hash_table::id_type i,n;
  if (state==0)
  { i=0; n=main_hash_table->nr_entries();
    l=std::strlen(text); // fix length for during search
  }
  while (i<n)
    // |i| is initialised above when |state==0|, and incremented below
  { const char* s=main_hash_table->name_of(i++);
      // get stored identifier and increment loop
    if (std::strncmp(text,s,l) == 0) // is |text| a prefix of |s|?
    { char* res=static_cast<char*>(std::malloc(std::strlen(s)+1));
        // we need a |malloc|ed string
      if (res==NULL)
	return NULL; // if memory gets full here, that's just too bad
      std::strcpy(res,s);
      return res;
    }
  }
  return NULL; /* if loop terminates, report failure */
}

@* The lexical analyser class.
%
We now come to the lexical analyser proper. Although only one lexical analyser
is envisaged, we shall define a class for it. The file \.{parser.tab.h}
contains definitions of constants defined by the parser and used in the code
below, but on its turn it uses types defined in \.{parsetree.h} which is
therefore loaded before it (we would like to have put an \&{\#include} of the
file \.{parsetree.h} into \.{parser.tab.h}, but do not know if or how this
could be arranged).

@h "parsetree.h"
@h "parser.tab.h"

@< Class declarations @>=
class Lexical_analyser
{ enum states @+ { initial, normal, ended };
@)BufferedInput& input;
  Hash_table& id_table;
  Hash_table::id_type keyword_limit; // first non-keyword identifier
  Hash_table::id_type type_limit; // first non-type identifier
  int nesting; // number of pending opening symbols
  char prevent_termination; // either |'\0'| or character requiring more input
  int comment_start, comment_end; // characters that start/end a comment
  states state; // to trigger special behaviour
  std::string file_name; // stores a file name for I/O redirection
public:
  Lexical_analyser
    (BufferedInput&, Hash_table&, const char**, const char** type_names);
  int get_token(YYSTYPE *valp, YYLTYPE* locp);
  bool reset(); // get clean slate, return |false| if |getline()| fails
  void set_comment_delims (char c, char d) @+
          {@; comment_start=c; comment_end=d; }
  const char* scanned_file_name() const {@; return file_name.c_str(); }
private:
  void skip_space();
  char* scan_quoted_string();
};

@ Since there is one lexical analyser object, and other parts of the program
must have access to it, we define a static variable with a pointer to it.

@< Declarations of static variables @>=
extern Lexical_analyser* lex;

@~We initialise this variable to the null pointer; the main program will make
it point to the main hash table once it is allocated.

@< Definitions of static variables @>=
Lexical_analyser* lex=NULL;


@ Here is the constructor for the lexical analyser, which assumes that a
buffered input object and an empty hash table object have been previously
constructed, and are passed by reference. Currently it is called with a list
of keyword strings as final parameter, which keywords will be installed into
the hash table and determine the value of |keyword_limit|. There will probably
be a need to further parametrise the lexical analyser, if we do not want to
hard-code all lexical details into it (there is nothing wrong with that as
long as there is only one object of this class, but the class concept invites
us to envision some more flexible use). One such parametrisation is via the
|comment_start| and |command_end| characters, that if set will automatically
skip text enclosed between them (they may or may not be equal). In the unset
state they are set to an integer that cannot match any |char| value; we would
have like to use |EOF| defined in \.{ctype.h} here, but it is only guaranteed
to be non-|(unsigned char)|, and since using the type |(unsigned char*)| is
unwieldy, we use another value.

@< Definitions of class members @>=
Lexical_analyser::Lexical_analyser
  (BufferedInput& source, Hash_table& hash,
   const char** keywords, const char** type_names)
: input(source),id_table(hash),nesting(0)
 ,prevent_termination('\0'),state(initial)
{ @< Install |keywords| and |type_names| into |id_table| @>
  comment_start=comment_end=256; // a non-|char| value
}

@ Keywords are identified by sequence number in the order by which they are
entered into |id_table|; therefore the order in the list |keyword| passed to
the constructor should match the numeric \.{\%token} values defined in
\.{parser.y}. The actual code transmitted for keywords will be obtained by
adding the constant |QUIT| to the value returned from the hash table look-up.
Type names are next in |id_table|, but they all will return the token |TYPE|,
while recording which names was entered in the semantic value.

@< Install |keywords| and |type_names| into |id_table| @>=
{ for (size_t i=0; keywords[i]!=0; ++i)
    id_table.match_literal(keywords[i]);
  keyword_limit=id_table.nr_entries();
  for (size_t i=0; type_names[i]!=0; ++i)
    id_table.match_literal(type_names[i]);
  type_limit=id_table.nr_entries();
}

@ The member function |reset| can be called to reset the lexical analyser,
discarding any remaining input on the current line and clearing the |nesting|
level. It is safe to call |reset| after a successfully executed command, which
will fetch a new line without getting any tokens, but |reset| should not be
called twice in succession, as this will discard the newly fetched line. The
result returned tells whether a fresh line was successfully obtained.

@< Definitions of class members @>=
bool Lexical_analyser::reset()
{@; nesting=0; state=initial; input.reset(); return input.getline(); }

@ Skipping spaces is a rather common activity during scanning; it is performed
by |skip_space|. When it is called, the first potential space character has
been shifted in, and when it returns a non-space character is left in
shifted-in position. Processing of newline-escaping backslashes and skipping
comments is also performed by |skip_space|. If |comment_start| is set and
|comment_end!='\n'|, then newlines will be skipped inside comments, but if
|comment_end=='\n'| then a closing newline will be considered for the
possibility of ending input. In the former case we change the input prompt by
pushing the comment character to warn the user that no action has been
performed. In case |prevent_termination| is set, that character is also pushed
into the prompt for the duration of skipping spaces.

In case end of input occurs one obtains |shift()=='\0'|, and for the end of an
included file one obtains |shift()=='\f'|, a form-feed. If the former happens
in the main loop of |skip_space| then we break from it like for any non-space
character, and although the following |input.unshift()| does nothing, the
value |'\0'| should reappear at the next call of |shift|. If end of input or a
form-feed occurs during a comment, then the comment is terminated (with an
error message) due to the explicit test, and the character that provoked this
will be reconsidered so the end of file will not be masked by the comment it
occurred inside.

    if (isspace(c))
    { if (c=='\n' and prevent_termination=='\0' and nesting==0
          or c=='\f')
        break;
// newline not skipped if some command could end here, form feed never skipped
      continue; // all other space is skipped
    }

          { std::cerr << "Comment that started on line " << line
                      << ", column " << column @| << " is never closed.\n";
          @/ input.unshift(); break;
          // force out of comment loop, reconsider character
          }

    else break; // non-space and non-comment character
  } while(true);
  if (prevent_termination!='\0') input.pop_prompt();
  input.unshift(); // prepare to re-read character that ended space
}

@ Another auxiliary method is used for scanning a quoted string; it should be
called when an initial double-quote character has been recognised, and after
scanning the string returns a pointer to the designated string (with quotes
and escapes removed), null terminated and allocated by |new[]|. We currently
use a simple model for strings. They should be contained in a single line, and
the only escapes used are the doubling of double-quote characters. We copy the
string while reducing doubled double-quote characters to single ones.

{ const char* start=input.point(),*end;
  int nr_quotes=0; // number of escaped quotes
  do
  { char c;
    do c=input.shift(); while (c!='"' && c!='\n' && c!='\0');
    if (c!='"')
    { input.unshift(); end=input.point();
      int l0,c0,l1,c1;
      input.locate(start,l0,c0); input.locate(end,l1,c1);
      input.show_range(cerr,l0,c0,l1,c1);
      cerr << "Closing string denotation.\n";
      break;
    }
    else if ((c=input.shift())!='"')
    {@; input.unshift(); end=input.point()-1; break; }
    else
      ++nr_quotes; // for doubled quotes, continue
  } while (true);
  size_t len=end-start-nr_quotes;
  char* s=new char[len+1];
  while (start<end) // copy characters, undoubling doubled quotes
    if ((*s++=*start++)=='"')
      ++start;
  *s='\0'; return s-len;
}


@*1 The main scanning routine.
%
Now we come to the function |get_token| that will actually be called by the
parser and return a token to it. The token is an integral value that is either
a character code in the case of single character tokens, or a token value
defined in \.{parser.tab.h}. The null token value has the special meaning of
signalling the end of the input to be recognised by the parser, which it wants
to see before returning successfully. Since our parser is written to recognise
individual commands rather than the full input source, we take measures to
send a null token after each command, even though the input buffer does
not signal end of input.

If it should happen that the input buffer does signal end of input by making
|input.shift()=='\0'|, then this will be transmitted to the parser as the end
of a command by the code below, by the general mechanism that characters that
are not specifically recognised are transmitted with a token value equal to
the character value. But this is really a marginal case, since the input
buffer guarantees that end of input cannot occur in the middle of a line;
normally the previous line will therefore be completely processed, and the
end-of-input condition is signalled by a failure of the call of the |reset|
method of the lexical analyser rather than by |input.shift()=='\0'| occurring
in its |getline| method. The only way the latter can happen is if the
preceding newline character was ignored by |skip_space|, due to
|prevent_termination| or |nesting|.

The way in which we arrange to signal the end of a command from |get_token| is
by sending \emph{two} successive tokens, a |'\n'| followed by a null token.
This strange setup is a work-around of a nasty property of the parsers
generated by \.{bison}, namely that on one hand the required terminal null
token is not representable in syntax rules (it should follow input matching
the target symbol, but is not part of its production), while on the other hand
the parser will perform any unambiguous reduction of the input it has seen,
even if the lookahead token is wrong for that reduction (so a syntax error
will be reported \emph{after} the reduction is performed). This means that if
we would define the syntax of commands normally, and if such a command would
occur correctly in the input but followed by extra tokens, then the reduction
recognising and executing the command would be performed \emph{before}
flagging a syntax error for the spurious tokens, which is undesirable.
Therefore we include into the production for any command the |'\n'| token that
is guaranteed by our lexical analyser to precede the terminating null token,
thus ensuring that the command will only be executed if it constitutes the
complete user input.

(One may imagine that premature reduction could cause problems in other
positions as well, but this is by far the most irritating case, and one where
no grammar rewriting can help.)

The implementation of this two-token termination reporting is by setting
|state=ended| when the token |'\n'| is returned, and testing this condition as
the first action in |get_token|, sending the following null token if it holds.
The |state| variable is also used to allow the scanner to behave differently
while scanning the very first token of a command, when |state==initial| will
hold; once a token is scanned, |state| is set to |normal| unless scanning had
set it to |ended|.

Besides returning a token code, each token defines a value for
|prevent_termination|. Since the previous value is only used in |skip_space|,
we set this variable to its most common value |'\0'| after the call to that
function, so that only for those tokens that cannot end a command we have to
set that value explicitly.

The code below also deals with setting the fields of the |locp| to delimit the
token scanned.

@< Definitions of class members @>=
int Lexical_analyser::get_token(YYSTYPE *valp, YYLTYPE* locp)
{ if (state==ended)
    {@; state=initial; return 0; } // send end of input
  skip_space(); prevent_termination='\0';
  input.locate(input.point(),locp->first_line,locp->first_column);
  int code; char c=input.shift();
  if (isalpha(c))
    @< Scan an identifier or a keyword @>
  else if (isdigit(c))
    @< Scan a number @>
  else

  input.locate(input.point(),locp->last_line,locp->last_column);
@/if (state==initial)
   state=normal;
  return code;
}

@ Everything that looks like an identifier is either that or a keyword, or a
type name. In any case we start with looking it up in the table, and then the
numeric value of the code returned will allow us to discriminate the
possibilities. In this scanner we cannot yet handle multiple distinct keywords
that should scan as the same category because of a similar syntactic role,
although this is probably desirable. However type names

@< Scan an identifier or a keyword @>=
{ const char* p=input.point@[()@]-1; // start of token

    c=input.shift();
  while(isalpha(c) || isdigit(c) || c=='_');

  Hash_table::id_type id_code=id_table.match(p,input.point()-p);
  if (id_code>=type_limit)
  {@; valp->id_code=id_code; code=IDENT; }

      case IN: if (input.top_prompt()=='L')
      {@; --nesting; input.pop_prompt(); prevent_termination='I'; }
      break;
      case END:
      case FI:
      case OD: --nesting; input.pop_prompt(); break;
      case WHATTYPE: prevent_termination='W'; break;
    }
  }
}

@ Numbers do not include a sign, and are always scanned as |unsigned long|
values.

  unsigned long val=*p++-'0'; @+  while (p<end) val=10*val+(*p++-'0');
  valp->val=val; code=INT;
}

@ After splitting off the alphanumeric characters, the scanner plunges into a
large switch on the value of the look-ahead character~|c|. We increase and
decrease nesting on obvious grouping characters, and for certain characters we
store them into |prevent_termination| to prevent a newline to be interpreted
as command termination. If in the |initial| state we find a |'<'| or |'>'|
character, then we prepare for input file inclusion or output redirection;
both tokens can be doubled to designate forced inclusion (if file was already
included before) respectively appending output redirection.

@ We hand to the parser a string denotation expression in |valp|, rather than

work that is usually left to the parser. The reason for this is that it avoids
having to extend union of possible token values with a variant for |(char *)|
and to define a corresponding destructor for in case the parser should decide
to drop the token because of a syntax error. In the current situation the
token value is a (string denotation) expression, and its destruction is

@ Since file names have a different lexical structure than identifiers, they
are treated separately in the scanner; moreover since at most one file name
can occur per command, we store it in a field |file_name| of the lexical
scanner reserved for that purpose. We allow a file name to be either a
sequence of non-space characters not starting with a quote, or a quoted
string.
